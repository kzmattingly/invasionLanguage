xabstract

Benthic macroinvertebrate communities were quantified at natural cobble and artificial
reef sites in Lake Ontario in 1983 (7 y pre-Dreissena invasion) and in 1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000
(1ñ2 and 9ñ10 y post-Dreissena invasion, respectively). Overall, the cobble community had higher
diversity and abundance than the reef community. In both communities, diversity and abundance of
non-Dreissena taxa rose sharply between 1983 and 1991 to 1992 and declined to 1983 levels by 1999
to 2000. However, taxonomic composition (excluding Dreissena and the recent invader Echinogammarus
ischnus) was consistent across study years. Between 1983 and 1999 to 2000, Stagnicola catascopium and
Physella spp. increased in abundance, several taxa (Musculium partumeium, Bithynia tentaculata, Elimia
livescens, Trichoptera, and Chironomidae) decreased in abundance, and changes in the abundance of
many taxa were correlated with Dreissena abundance. Dreissena continued to make up .40% of total
macroinvertebrate abundance at the cobble site and .60% at the reef site in 1999 to 2000; however,
numbers dropped sharply and the size of individual mussels increased as D. bugensis largely replaced
D. polymorpha between 1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000. Dreissena biomass dropped sharply at the reef
site between 1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000, but not at the cobble site. The exotic amphipod E. ischnus
was abundant in 1999 to 2000, but any effect on the abundance of the related amphipod Gammarus
fasciatus was unclear. At the time of this study, the round goby Neogobius melanostomus was not present.
We conclude that the transition from D. polymorpha to D. bugensis and processes associated with the
ongoing oligotrophication of Lake Ontario are responsible for reduced density of larger-bodied Dreissena
in the nearshore region, and that changes in the Dreissena population are largely responsible for
changes in the non-Dreissena benthic macroinvertebrate communities.


xintroduction
Nutrient loading and species introductions
are thought to be 2 of the major environmental
problems currently facing freshwater ecosystems (Richter et al. 1997, Hall et al. 2003), and
both of these anthropogenic factors are of concern
in the Great Lakes. The number of exotic
species in the Great Lakes continues to increase
(Ricciardi 2001), and nutrient levels have declined
after changes in human inputs (Hall et
al. 2003, Mills et al. 2003). Both of these anthropogenically
controlled factors have the potential
to alter secondary productivity and invertebrate
community structure. The potential also exists
for exotics and changing nutrient levels to interact,
or for them to interact with abiotic factors

 such as habitat or climate, to restructure benthic
macroinvertebrate communities in lakes.
One exotic species known to interact with
benthic macroinvertebrate communities on hard
substrates in littoral zones of lakes are mussels
of the genus Dreissena (Griffiths 1993, Ricciardi
et al. 1997, Karatayev et al. 1997). Dreissena positively
affects benthic grazers on local (Stewart
et al. 1998a, b, Kuhns and Berg 1999) and system-wide
(Mayer et al. 2002) scales. However,
Dreissena also negatively affects benthic invertebrate
communities, especially filter-feeding or
deep-dwelling invertebrates that rely on detrital
rain (Dermott and Munawar 1993, Strayer et al.
1998, Johannsson et al. 2000). Strayer et al.
(1998) pointed out that the overall effects of
Dreissena on macroinvertebrates may be positive
or negative, and that community responses depend
on critical habitat characteristics (e.g.,
depth, substrate type, current velocity, nutrients,
productivity).
Similarly, effects of changing nutrient levels
on benthic invertebrates may be difficult to predict
because of their variety of feeding strategies.
Some consume organic material originally
produced in the pelagic zone and subsequently
deposited on the bottom as detritus, whereas
others graze on benthic primary producers.
Benthic invertebrates with different feeding
strategies may respond differently to changes in
nutrient levels because a tradeoff probably exists
between benthic and pelagic primary production
with changing nutrient levels. For example,
phytoplankton may be controlled by nutrients
(Schindler 1977), whereas some benthic primary
producers are light-limited (Duarte 1995, Millard
et al. 1996). These factors may be confounded
in lakes where shading is usually from phytoplankton.
Therefore, predicting benthic invertebrate
community response to a change in nutrient
levels is very difficult, and the potential
synergistic effects of nutrient alterations and exotics
such as Dreissena are complex.
Long-term studies can illuminate the interactions
of exotic species, previously established
communities, and changes in other environmental
factors. Here, we analyze a unique data set
collected on natural cobble and artificial reef
substrates in southwestern Lake Ontario over a
17-y period that spanned the introduction of
Dreissena. Benthic invertebrate communities
were sampled in 1983 (7 y pre-Dreissena invasion;
Bader 1985) and in 1991 to 1992 (1ñ2 y
post-Dreissena invasion; Stewart and Haynes
1994). The initial post-Dreissena sampling in
1991 to 1992 showed that even though Dreissena
constituted 42 to 78% of the benthic fauna, other
macroinvertebrates were more diverse and more
abundant than before the arrival of Dreissena.
However, differences between the 1995 and 1983
communities were much less pronounced
(Haynes et al. 1999). We repeated the sampling
in 1999 to 2000. This expanded time scale allowed
us to assess changes in these benthic invertebrate
consortia (Karatayev et al. 1997) over
a period of time in which nutrient levels remained
stable (Millard et al. 1996, Hall et al.
2003, Mills et al. 2003) and other exotic species
(e.g., the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus,
and the amphipod Echinogammarus ischnus) colonized
Lake Ontario.
The major objective of our study was to evaluate
long-term changes in the benthic macroinvertebrate
community, collectively and within
individual taxa, in relation to the Dreissena invasion
of southwestern Lake Ontario. Establishing
relationships between changes in the benthic
community and Dreissena required eliminating
or separating other factors that might
have caused the changes we observed. These
factors include the weather preceding sampling,
predation or competition, and temporal and
spatial differences in sampling (year, month,
habitat).
xmethods



Sampling methods for our study were reported
in Bader (1985), Stewart and Haynes (1994),
and Haynes et al. (1999). Samples were collected
within same 2 to 3 wk periods in May, July, August,
and September during 1983, 1991 to 1992,
and 1999 to 2000. Five replicate samples (3 min
each) were collected with a dome suction sampler
(Gale and Thompson 1975) along 30-m
transects on each of the natural cobble and artificial
reef substrates in 5 to 7 m of water 1.6
km west of Olcott, New York (map in Stewart
and Haynes 1994). When run with a freshly
charged battery, the pump attached to the suction
sampler could pump water at a constant
rate for 30 min in the laboratory. Each transect
was sampled using a freshly charged battery. If
the sampler clogged, the 3-min timer was stopped, the system was cleared, and the timer
was restarted. The collection method did not
sample unionid bivalves because they were too
widely scattered to be found in the 0.165 m2
area of the sampler. The method also underestimated
the abundance of Dreissena because the
suction power of the sampler did not dislodge
all of them from rocks. Thus, dome suction sampler
counts of Dreissena are relative, not absolute,
density estimates.Taxonomically related macroinvertebrates
were combined so that they numbered $10/m2
in $1 sampling year. This technique caused
some loss of taxonomic resolution, but it facilitated
statistical comparisons across years (1983,
1991ñ1992, 1999ñ2000), months (May, July, August,
September), and habitats (cobble, reef).
The following taxa were combined for analysis:
Turbellaria (flatworms), Oligochaeta (aquatic
earthworms), and Hirudinea (leeches) as
Worms; small numbers of Gyraulus and Helisoma
snails as family Planorbidae; and a few taxa in
each of Trichoptera (caddisflies), Ephemeroptera
(mayflies), and Chironomidae (midgeflies) as
Insecta, resulting in 15 taxa for analysis. Macroinvertebrate
counts (1983 data from Bader
1985) were converted to no./m2 for each taxon
for each sampling month, and transformed
(log[no./m2 1 1]).
Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) and
Tukeyís Honestly Significant Difference (HSD)
tests (Statistix 2001, version 7.0, Analytical Software,
Tallahassee, Florida) were used to evaluate
changes in Dreissena and other taxa, individually
and collectively, by year, month, and habitat.
For these data, the level of significance was
a 5 0.05, but a trend was noted if 0.05 ,a,
0.1. In addition, environmental variables (air
temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) during
the 30 d preceding each sampling day were
compared (after log[x 1 1] transformations) by
1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Statistix
2001). Pearson correlation and stepwise regression
were used to establish relationships among
benthic macroinvertebrate abundance (dependent
variable) and Dreissena abundance and the
environmental variables (Statistix 2001). Wet
masses of whole and fragmented Dreissena with
shells were calculated as reported in Stewart
(1993), and differences between Dreissena biomass
at the cobble and reef sites were compared
by KruskalñWallis 1-way nonparametric ANOVA
(Statistix 2001).
Multivariate analyses (PC-ORD 1999, MJM
Software, Gleneden Beach, Oregon) were done
on the log(no./m2 1 1)-transformed data. Cluster
analysis (Unweighted Pair-Group Method
using Arithmetic Averages, Sorenson distance
measure) gave insight into relationships among
non-Dreissena benthic macroinvertebrate communities
in different years, months, and habitats.
Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)
displayed relationships among non-Dreissena
taxa and Dreissena and environmental conditions
30 d before each sampling date.
xresults

Dreissena abundance was higher in 1991 to
1992 than in 1999 to 2000 (p , 0.0001), and
higher at the reef than at the cobble site (p ,
0.0001). Dreissena abundance did not differ
among months (p 5 0.179), and no interactions
among months, years, or habitats were statistically
significant. In 1991 to 1992, D. bugensis
constituted ;1% of the Dreissena community at
each study site (Stewart and Haynes 1994), but
by 1999 to 2000 it was the dominant dreissenid
at the cobble (80%) and reef (87%) sites. During
1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000, the relative abundance
of Dreissena was .47% at the study sites,
but absolute abundance decreased by factors of
5 and 10 at the cobble and reef sites, respectively
(Table 1).
The trend of decreased Dreissena abundance
was not fully paralleled by changes in biomass.
Between 1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000, Dreissena
biomass did not change at the cobble site
(483 1 116 [SE] vs 328 1 54 g/m2
, p 5 0.753),
but biomass declined markedly at the reef site
(1123 1 187 vs 434 1 62 g/m2
, p 5 0.004). However,
mean individual mussel size approximately
doubled (0.09 and 0.12 g/individual in 1991ñ
1992, and 0.22 and 0.20 g/individual in 1999ñ
2000 at the cobble and reef sites, respectively).Many of the changes described above were
statistically significant (Table 3). For all taxa
combined, abundance was significantly higher
in 1991 to 1992 than in 1983 or 1999 to 2000.
Individual taxa that were significantly more
abundant in 1991 to 1992 than in the other sampling
years included Worms, Planorbidae, Valvatidae,
Hydrobiidae, Pleuroceridae, Cambaridae,
Trichoptera, and Other. Several taxa (Lymnaeidae,
Physidae, Bithyniidae, and Gammaridae)
were significantly more abundant in 1991
to 1992 than in 1 of the other 2 sampling years.
Only Chironomidae was significantly less abundant
in 1991 to 1992 than in another year, and
only Ephemeroptera (always in low abundance)
showed no difference in abundance among
years.
For combined taxa, abundance was signifi-
cantly greater at the cobble habitat than at the
reef habitat, and the same was true for 9 of the
15 individual taxa (Worms, Sphaeriidae, Planorbidae,
Valvatidae, Pleuroceridae, Cambaridae,
Chironomidae, Trichoptera [p 5 0.079], and
Other; Table 3). Abundance of all taxa combined
did not differ among months, and the same was
true for 6 of the 15 taxa. For 7 of the remaining
9 taxa, macroinvertebrate abundance was lower
in May than in one or more other months.
The interactions among years, months, or
habitats were not significant for all taxa combined
and for 5 of the 15 individual taxa. Taxa
significantly affected by a month 3 year interaction
were Planorbidae, Physidae, Hydrobiidae,
Pleuroceridae, Chironomidae, and Other; taxa
significantly affected by a habitat 3 month interaction
were Planorbidae, Pleuroceridae, and
Chironomidae; and taxa significantly affected
by a year 3 habitat interaction were Sphaeriidae,
Physidae, Valvatidae, Pleuroceridae, Cambaridae,
Trichoptera, and Other (Table 3)Environmental variables. For the 30-d period
before sampling, the high, low, and mean air
temperatures were lower in May and higher in
July and August of 1983 than in other years. Air
temperatures did not differ among years in September,
and neither solar radiation nor precipitation
differed among years for any sampling
month (Table 4). Correlations among environmental
variables were strong and significant
(range: r 5 20.762ñ0.724, p , 0.0001), but no
relationship was identified between Dreissena
and the environmental variables (range: r 5
0.016ñ0.069, p 5 0.190ñ0.764). In stepwise regression,
the relationships between the abundance
of non-Dreissena taxa and temperature (p
5 0.610), precipitation (p 5 0.807), and solar radiation
(p 5 0.573) were not significant, but the
relationship between the abundance of nonDreissena
taxa and Dreissena abundance was
strong (p 5 0.0004).
Community relationships. Colonization of the
reef site in 1983 by taxa from nearby cobble habitat
was rapid, and species richness was similar
between the sites. In 1983, months after construction
of the reef (Bader 1985), 15 and 13 taxa
(as combined in Table 1) were collected at the
cobble and reef sites, respectively. Among nonDreissena
taxa, 17 and 13 taxa were found at the
cobble and reef sites, respectively, in 1991 to
1992 and 16 and 13 taxa were found at the same
sites in 1999 to 2000. As expected for a lessdiverse
substrate, the reef site (limestone cobbles/boulders)
had slightly fewer taxa than the
cobble site (sandstone cobbles/mud) in all
years.
Three clusters of samples were identified (Fig.
1). One cluster consisted of all of the monthly
samples from 1991 to 1992, the 2nd consisted of
5 of the 8 samples from 1983, and the 3rd consisted
of the samples from 1999 to 2000 and the
remaining samples from 1983. The 1991 to 1992
community was distinctly different from the
somewhat-overlapping 1983 and 1999 to 2000
communities. In addition, monthly cobble and
reef samples were mixed in 1983 and in 1999 to
2000, whereas in 1991 to 1992, the monthly cobble
samples clustered separately from the
monthly reef samples. This result indicates that

 the arrival of Dreissena in 1991 to 1992 influenced
the 2 non-Dreissena communities differently.
In a separate cluster analysis (not shown),
the mean annual abundance of each taxon (May,
July, August, and September sample means
combined) was computed for each habitat (cobble,
reef) in each year of the study (1983, 1991ñ
1992, 1999ñ2000). In that analysis, cobble and
reef communities in each year clustered together,
indicating that, on an annual basis, there
were few differences between the benthic communities
on artificial and natural substrates.
CCA was used to explore further the relationships
among non-Dreissena taxa and Dreissena
(Fig. 2). All axes were canonical, but little of the
variation among taxa along axes 1 (17.5%), 2
(5.9%), and 3 (3.7%) was explained by the 3 environmental
variables and Dreissena. The eigenvalue
(0.069) for axis 1 was significant (p 5
0.004), but eigenvalues for axes 2 (0.023) and 3
(0.015) were not (p 5 0.124 and 0.058, respectively).
Dreissena abundance was strongly correlated
with axis 1 (r 5 0.986), solar radiation
was strongly correlated with axis 2 (r 5 20.973),
and temperature and precipitation were strongly
correlated with axis 3 (r 5 20.838 and 0.615,
respectively). Speciesñenvironment correlations
(1000 Monte Carlo simulations) were significant
for axes 1 (p 5 0.002) and 2 (p 5 0.004), but not
for axis 3 (p 5 0.608). Relationships were sought
on all 3 axes of the CCA because of high correlations
among environmental variables and
the nearly significant eigenvalue for CCA axis 3.
Axes 1 and 3 gave the clearest view of our data
(Fig. 2).
A number of interesting patterns emerged
from the CCA. All of the 1983 monthly samples
(pre-Dreissena) arrayed on the negative side of
axis 1, the Dreissena axis of the CCA, whereas
all but one of the post-Dreissena monthly samples
arrayed on the positive side of axis 1 (Fig.
2). No Dreissena were collected at the cobble site
in September 1999, so that month was among
the 1983 sampling months. In hindsight, the
barren appearance and sparse benthic macroinvertebrate
community at this sampling site
suggested that it had been disturbed by storms
or scoured by ice. The CCA identified the September
1999 sample as unusual, and this identification
increased our confidence in the ability
of the analysis to identify correctly the relationships
of non-Dreissena taxa and sampling
months to the canonical axes (Fig. 2). For example,
axis 3 represented a combination of the
inversely related (r 5 20.762) temperature and
precipitation variables. Monthly samples from
May through September in all years are arrayed
along a coldñwet (positive side) to warmñdry
(negative side) continuum.
The MANOVA, cluster analysis, CCA, and
narrative results presented above showed remarkable
agreement on changes in the macroinvertebrate
communities at the study sites. The
1999 to 2000 community was more like the 1983
community than either was like the 1991 to 1992
community (Fig. 1); this result corresponds with
colonization by Dreissena after 1989 and the decline
of Dreissena between 1991 to 1992 and 1999
to 2000 (Table 1). Taxa with abundances that
rose and fell with the abundance of Dreissena
have values near the origin on axis 1 of the CCA
(the Dreissena axis, Fig. 2), whereas taxa with
abundances negatively or positively associated
with Dreissena have values to the left or right of
the origin, respectively. The abundances of 7
taxa (Worms, Planorbidae, Pleuroceridae, G. fasciatus,
Cambaridae, Trichoptera, Other) had
scores between 20 and 80 (out of 100) on axis 1
and were positively correlated with Dreissena
abundance (Table 1). Two taxa (Lymnaeidae,
Physidae) with scores between 20 and 80 on axis
1 were exceptions to the pattern; they increased
sharply between 1983 and 1991 to 1992 and remained
high in 1999 to 2000. These taxa seem
not to have been affected by the decline in Dreissena
abundance. Two taxa (Hydrobiidae, Valvatidae),
whose abundances also were positively
correlated with Dreissena abundance, had scores
.80 on CCA axis 1 (Fig. 2). The cause of this
pattern is not clear, but Valvatidae numbered
.10/m2 only in 1991 to 1992 (Table 1) and their
low sample sizes may have influenced the CCA.
The 3 taxa (Sphaeriidae, Ephemeroptera, Chironomidae)
with scores ,20 (Fig. 2) virtually
disappeared from the study sites between 1991
to 1992 and 1999 to 2000 (Table 1).
xdiscussion

The effects of exotic species such as Dreissena
on native communities are difficult to predict,
especially in the case of benthic macroinvertebrate
communities that include a wide variety
of feeding guilds and ecological niches. Further,effects arising from an exotic species are diffi-
cult to differentiate from effects caused by natural
or anthropogenic environmental changes or
the effects of patchy distributions on sampling
results. We used a unique long-term data set to
evaluate changes in the non-Dreissena nearshore
benthic community after exotic species introductions
in Lake Ontario but over a period of
stable P levels.
Several trends in the non-Dreissena communities
were apparent from 1983 to 2000, despite
the temporal and spatial variability characteristic
of benthic communities. First, the 1983 and
1999 to 2000 non-Dreissena communities were
more closely related to each other than either
was to the 1991 to 1992 community. Specifically,
the abundances of non-dreissenids overall, and
of most individual taxa, were higher in 1991 to
1992 (1ñ2 y post-Dreissena) than in 1983 (7 y preDreissena)
and in 1999 to 2000 (7ñ9 y post-Dreissena).
Second, the abundances of non-dreissenids
and most individual taxa were higher at the
cobble site than at the reef site. Third, neither
overall benthic macroinvertebrate abundance
nor abundances of 40% of individual taxa differed
among sampling months (May, July, August,
September), but nearly half of the individual
taxa were less abundant in May than in one
or more other months. Fourth, D. bugensis became
the most abundant member of the benthic
community, exceeding D. polymorpha abundance
by a factor of 3.4 in 1999 to 2000. Fifth, the abundance
of Dreissena declined sharply between
1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000, but the average
mass of individuals doubled. Dreissena biomass
remained unchanged at the cobble site, but decreased
sharply at the artificial reef where dreissenid
numbers had exploded in 1991 to 1992.
Sixth, significant correlations were found among
environmental variables (temperature, precipitation,
and sunlight), but no significant relationships
were found between environmental variables
and the abundances of Dreissena and nonDreissena
taxa. Seventh, E. ischnus colonized the
study sites between 1995 and 1999, and became
the 3rd-most-abundant taxon.Establishing cause-and-effect relationships
between changes in benthic communities and
environmental factors is difficult, and our 17-y
observational data set cannot do so. Our data
point to Dreissena as the driver of change from
1983 to 2000, but other factors may have influenced
the richness and abundances of nonDreissena
taxa. These factors include predation,
new exotic species, benthic algae, competition,
or temporal changes in environmental conditions.
Before arguing for Dreissena as the chief
driver, we explore these other potential influences.
Predation. Haynes et al. (1999) excluded predation
by aquatic fauna as a cause for the decline
of invertebrate taxa between 1991 to 1992 and 1995. However, small-bodied snails such as
Gyraulus and Amnicola may have avoided predation
in the many small interstitial spaces of
D. polymorpha during the early phase of colonization,
and they may have lost this refuge in the
fewer large interstitial spaces of D. bugensis now
dominant along the southern shore of Lake Ontario
(Mills et al. 1999).
The assemblage of small and juvenile fishes
(slimy sculpin, Cottus cognatus; johnny darter,
Etheostoma nigrum; pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus;
rock bass, Ambloplites rupestris; smallmouth
bass, Micropterus dolomieu; yellow perch,
Perca flavescens) has remained unchanged at our
study sites since 1983 (Merritt 1985, Haynes
1991, 1995); therefore, new forms of fish predation
are an unlikely cause of the changes observed
in the non-Dreissena community. A possible
exception may be selective predation on
crayfish (Orconectes spp.) by increasing numbers
of freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) that
also eat Dreissena (JMH, personal observation).
Transect surveys by SCUBA and baited minnow
traps failed to produce evidence of round gobies
at our study sites in 1999 to 2000. As the round
goby becomes established at our study sites (it
is now common in Lake Ontario), it may well
alter the benthic community (Dubs and Corkum
1996, Kuhns and Berg 1999, French and Jude
2001, Gonzalez and Burkhart 2004).
Petrie and Knapton (1999) reported high levels
of predation by waterfowl on dreissenids at
Long Point Bay, Lake Erie where the habitat was
shallow (0ñ4 m), highly vegetated, and muddybottomed.
Given the substantial differences in
substrate type and depth between our study
sites and Long Point Bay, and the fact that we
saw no waterfowl during .15 sampling trips
since 1990, it is unlikely that waterfowl predation
accounts for the reductions in Dreissena.
It appears unlikely that predation from any
source has caused the overall decline in nonDreissena
abundance at our sites. However, the
effect of larger interstitial spaces created by D.
bugensis on selective predation of certain taxa
should be explored experimentally.
A new exotic species. After E. ischnus colonized
our study sites, it replaced G. fasciatus as
the most abundant non-Dreissena member of the
community (33% and 64% of amphipod abundance
at the cobble and reef sites, respectively).
Similar results have been observed in Lake Erie
(Stewart et al. 1998a, b, Ratti and Barton 2003).
Van Overdijk et al. (2003) and Gonzalez and
Burkart (2004) reported that E. ischnus predominated
on dressenid substrate in the lab and
field, but G. fasciatus was more abundant in macrophytes.
The 2 species were distributed evenly,
especially at higher densities, on substrates with
both Cladophora and Dreissena. Gonzalez and
Burkart (2004) showed that interhabitat differences
in diet did not explain observed abundance
patterns, but fish predation did. Both yellow
perch and round goby preferred E. ischnus
in macrophytes and G. fasciatus among dreissenids.
Echinogammarus ischnus appeared to be favored in dreissenid habitat, the major habitat
available at our sites; therefore, it has the potential
to further displace G. fasciatus, as suggested
by our data. However, our data provide no evidence
that E. ischnus has affected other nonDreissena
taxa relative to conditions in 1995
(Haynes et al. 1999).
Benthic algae. Haynes et al. (1999) hypothesized
that thick growths of filamentous green
algae may have accounted for lower abundances
of benthic macroinvertebrates in 1995, relative to
abundances in 1991 to 1992 when no algae was
present, by interfering with the ability of benthic
macroinvertebrates to attach or feed. Water clarity
increased substantially at our sites and
throughout the Great Lakes following colonization
by Dreissena (MacIsaac 1996, Nicholls 1997),
and clarity remained high in 1999 to 2000. However,
few filamentous algae were observed at
our sites in 1999 to 2000, and few changes in
macroinvertebrate abundance or diversity were
observed between 1995 (Haynes et al. 1999) and
1999 to 2000. Therefore, benthic algal cover cannot
account for observed changes in the invertebrate
communities at the cobble and reef sites.
Temporal environmental variation. Temporal
environmental variations, rather than Dreissena,
could have accounted for the differences in macroinvertebrate
communities among years. Unfortunately,
only one pre-Dreissena data set
(1983) is available, so interannual changes in
community structure potentially caused by
Dreissena cannot be separated clearly from other
effects. Stepwise regression and CCA showed
no associations among the physical environmental
variables, Dreissena, and the non-Dreissena
communities. Moreover, an extensive survey
along the Canadian shore of Lake Ontario found
no effects of fetch, upwelling, or substrate (all
particle sizes from clay to bedrock) on the structure
of benthic communities at 5-m depths (Kilgour
et al. 2000). The 2 trends that are apparent in our non-Dreissena data are a sharp increase
in abundance from 1983 to 1991 to 1992 and a
substantial decrease toward 1983 levels since
1991 to 1992. These trends have no counterparts
in the physical environmental data we and Kilgour
et al. (2000) examined. Thus, there is no
evidence that the physical variables measured
played a role in structuring nearshore benthic
communities in Lake Ontario.Dreissena is the most likely factor accounting
for the community changes we observed. The
changes reported here are not unusual for benthic
communities on hard substrates in the
Great Lakes, and they suggest a geographically
broad phenomenon that has implications for
Dreissena-impacted food webs. Dreissena abundance
rises exponentially soon after colonization
(e.g., Stewart and Haynes 1994, Nalepa et
al. 2003), and the diversity, abundance, or biomass
of non-dreissenids rise in the short term
(Dermott et al. 1993, Griffiths 1993, Stewart and
Haynes 1994) followed by declines to near preDreissena
conditions (Haynes et al. 1999). In addition,
non-Dreissena species composition also
changes. The typical pattern is an increase in
snail abundance, a decrease in insect abundance,
and continuing prominence of gammarids (Nalepa
et al. 2003, Ratti and Barton 2003). Most
authors cited above attributed these changes to
Dreissena.
Short-term manipulative experiments conducted
on hard substrates in shallow water
demonstrated that Dreissena caused positive
changes in biomass and abundance of other
benthic macroinvertebrates (Wisenden and Bailey
1995, Ricciardi et al. 1997, Thayer et al. 1997,
Kuhns and Berg 1999). For example, Stewart et
al. (1998a, b) showed that non-Dreissena biomass
was 53 greater on substrates with ;7500 dreissenids/m2
than on substrates with ;680/m2
.
Corroborative field evidence showed that dreissenid
densities averaging 730/m2 (range: 0ñ
3250/m2
) had no effect on community structure
(Kilgour et al. 2000). These results show general
agreement with our results; decreases in densities
of Dreissena (cobble: 3.53 decrease, reef:
4.43 decrease) corresponded with decreases in
densities of non-dreissenids (cobble: 2.23 decrease,
reef: 3.13 decrease) at our study sites
between 1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000.
Several factors associated with Dreissena probably
accounted for the changes in the abundance
of non-Dreissena taxa we observed between
1991 to 1992 and 1999 to 2000. Dreissena
feces and pseudofeces are energy-rich resources
for detritus-feeding invertebrates (Izvekova and
Lvova-Katchanova 1972, Roditi et al. 1997), and
they provide substrate and shelter for some
taxa. In the presence of higher densities of
smaller Dreissena at our study sites in 1991 to
1992, more detritus was available for feeding
and more shell area was available for attachment
(Stewart et al. 1998a, b). In addition, smaller interstitial
spaces may have provided protection
from predation and may have trapped organic
particles that otherwise would be washed away
and unavailable as food (Stewart et al. 1998a, b).
Change from D. polymorpha to D. bugensis.
Mills et al. (1999) found a sharp increase and a
strong westward gradient of D. bugensis biomass
from 1992 to 1995 at depths of 15 to 130 m on
the southern shore of Lake Ontario. At the same
time, Mills et al. (1999) observed decreases by
factors of 2 to 17 in D. polymorpha biomass. Dreissena
polymorpha biomass was higher than D. bugensis
biomass only at the shallowest depth sampled
by Mills et al. (1999), a result consistent
with our observations, where both dreissenid
species were present at our sites in western Lake
Ontario (7 m), but D. bugensis predominated in
1999 to 2000. The shift from D. polymorpha to D.
bugensis (100:1 ratio in 1991ñ1992 to 100:343 ratio
in 1999ñ2000) coincided with an approximate
halving of non-Dreissena taxa abundance.
Our data cannot answer whether changed dreissenid
dominance played a role in the observed
alteration of the non-Dreissena community, but
they are suggestive.
Competition. Driessena may out-compete other
filter-feeders for food or smother organisms
such as unionids (Lewandowski 1976, Hunter
and Bailey 1992, Stanczykowska and Lewandowski
1993). Dreissena polymorpha colonized
southern Lake Michigan in 1991 and settled on
sphaeriids .1 mm in diameter. By 1997, sphaeriids
at a depth of 10 m had disappeared (Lauer
and McComish 2001). Similar disappearances of
sphaeriids after dreissenid invasion have been
reported in Lake Ontario (Haynes et al. 1999),
in Lake Erie (Nalepa et al. 1996, Dermott and
Kerec 1997, Johannsson et al. 2000), in Lake
Michigan (Nalepa et al. 1998), in Saginaw Bay
in Lake Huron (Nalepa et al. 2003), in the Hudson River (Strayer et al. 1998), and in the Illinois
River (Tucker 1994). In addition, Ratti and Barton
(2003) suggested that filter-feeding hydropsychid
caddisflies were displaced by D. bugensis
in the wave zone of eastern Lake Erie, just as
filter-feeding chironomids have been displaced
by Dreissena in deep water in eastern Lake Erie
(Dermott and Kerec 1997).We think the declines in non-Dreissena benthic
macroinvertebrate abundance are strongly
linked to the declines in Dreissena densities at
our study sites. Two factors support this contention.
1) Dreissena abundance and biomass decreased
at our study sites and throughout Lake
Ontario (Mills et al. 1999, Kilgour et al. 2000),
and densities of non-Dreissena taxa are clearly
related to Dreissena densities (Stewart et al.
1998a, b, Kuhns and Berg 1999, Mayer et al.
2002). 2) None of the physical or chemical factors
(e.g., substrate, depth, weather, P) that potentially
could alter benthic habitat sufficiently
to create the changes seen in the benthic communities
of Lake Ontario have changed signifi-
cantly across sampling years at our sites, and
fetch and upwelling also do not appear to influence
benthic invertebrate communities in Lake
Ontario (Kilgour et al. 2000).
The overall decline in Lake Ontarioís productivity
after decades of planned P reductions (oligotrophication)
probably has contributed to the
decreasing density of Dreissena. The bottom-up
effect (Carpenter et al. 1986, McQueen et al.
1989) of less P entering Lake Ontario (Hall et al.
2003, Mills et al. 2003) and more P probably
bound up long-term in Dreissena shells may
have translated into lower phytoplankton production
by decoupling chlorophyll a and total P
in the nearshore region of Lake Ontario (Hall et
al. 2003). The consequences probably were less
food for dreissenid mussels, less feces and pseudofeces
production as food for other invertebrates,
and fewer bacterial decomposers (Mills
et al. 1995, 2003). Therefore, we predict that unless
more P becomes available in the food web
leading to Dreissena, benthic invertebrate abundance
and biomass will continue to decline to
levels at or below those before the Dreissena invasion.
