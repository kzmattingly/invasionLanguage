xabstract
Assessing the effects of invading species on native community structure is often
confounded by environmental factors and weakened by lack of replicated, longterm
pre- and post-invasion monitoring. Here, we uncouple the community effects
of a freshwater amphipod invader from environmental differences. In Irish rivers, the
introduced Gammarus pulex replaces the native Gammarus duebeni celticus. However,
the River Lissan in Northern Ireland is dissected by a weir that has slowed the
upstream invasion by G. pulex. This allowed us in 2000 to sample three contiguous
150-m reaches that were (1) G. pulex dominated; (2) mixed Gammarus spp.; and
(3) G. duebeni celticus only. In 2003, we resampled these reaches and one additional
of mixed Gammarus species and one with only G. duebeni celticus further upstream.
In temperature, conductivity, and pH, there were statistically significant but no
biologically relevant differences among the five reaches of 2003, and between the
three reaches surveyed in both years. Although there was evidence of recovery in
macroinvertebrate diversity and richness in invaded reaches between years, continued
upstream invasion was associated with sustained reductions in these community metrics
as compared to un-invaded sites. Community ordination indicated (1) different associations
of community composition attributed to the distribution, abundance, and biomass
of the invader; and (2) increasing similarity of invaded communities over time. The
impact mechanisms of G. pulex on macroinvertebrate community composition may
include predation and competition. The consequences of the observed community
changes for ecosystem functioning require further investigation.
xintroduction
Human activity continues to increase the rate of biological
invasions and the frequency of interactions among natives and
invaders (Ricciardi & Rasmussen, 1998; Ricciardi & MacIsaac,
2000; van der Velde et al., 2000; Dick et al., 2002; Jenkins, 2003).
With some freshwater systems apparently poised for ëinvasional
meltdowní, research priorities now focus on explaining and
predicting the impact of invaders on native communities
(Ricciardi & Rasmussen, 1998; Ricciardi, 2001; Dick et al., 2002).
However, as successful freshwater invasions often accompany
environmental degradation or a major disturbance (Ricciardi
et al., 1998; van der Velde et al., 2000), it remains difficult to
separate the direct effects of invaders on native communities
from any environmental effects (MacNeil et al., 2000, 2001;
Boudreau & Yan, 2003). Thus, situations must be sought where
potentially confounding environmental factors are minimized.
Furthermore, to test whether populations of invading species
senesce over time and whether communities are resilient to
disturbance by invaders, long-term studies as opposed to
the transitory ësnap-shotí approach of the single survey are
required to fully evaluate the impacts of invaders (Cronk &
Fuller, 1996; Petrie & Knapton, 1999; Dernie et al., 2003;
MacNeil et al., 2003).
In Europe, the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex (L.)
actively replaces Gammarus duebeni celticus Stock & Pinkster,
1970, with differential mutual intraguild predation (IGP; see
Polis et al., 1989) cited as a driving force (Dick et al., 1993, 1999).
In Northern Irelandís rivers, the introduced G. pulex rapidly
replaces the native G. duebeni celticus in lowland stretches, with short stretches of coexistence upstream and, finally, un-invaded
stretches of G. duebeni celticus uppermost (Dick et al., 1994;
MacNeil et al., 2001, 2004; Kelly & Dick, 2005a). Macroinvertebrate
community composition and diversity differ significantly among
these three stretch types (MacNeil et al., 2000, 2001; Kelly &
Dick, 2005a). As the three stretch types occur over spatial scales
of tens of kilometres (e.g. see MacNeil et al., 2004), longitudinal
gradients in environmental factors may be the determinants
of community changes. However, community differences may
be driven to some degree by differences in the effects of the two
Gammarus species, this being confounded by the environmental
gradients. Indeed, an increasing number of studies have indicated
that G. duebeni celticus and G. pulex may be strongly interactive
with the macroinvertebrate community (MacNeil et al., 1997,
2003). Furthermore, laboratory studies indicate that G. pulex has
a greater predatory impact on some macroinvertebrates than
G. duebeni celticus (Kelly et al., 2002a; Kelly & Dick, 2005a).
However,separating the role of such biotic interactions in structuring
these communities from the influence of distinct longitudinal
changes in the riverine environment remains problematic (see
also Vannote et al., 1980; MacNeil et al., 2001).
During 2000, Kelly et al. (2003) identified a lowland stretch of
the River Lissan, Northern Ireland, where an artificial weir had
slowed the upstream invasion by G. pulex, presenting a situation
where G. duebeni celticuswas present in a lowland reach (upstream
of the weir), with a short reach immediately above the weir where
the two species co-occurred. This presented a unique opportunity
to assess differences in macroinvertebrate community composition
in reaches with invader, mixed, and native Gammarus species
over a spatial scale of only 800 m, where longitudinal environmental
changes were not confounding factors. G. pulex is the
only non-indigenous species that we have found in this river.
Observations suggest that the G. pulex invasion occurred only
a few years prior to our 2000 study (A. Keys, pers. comm.;
see Kelly et al., 2003). Macroinvertebrate community composition,
biomass, and diversity differed markedly among these three
reaches, leading Kelly et al. (2003) to conclude that the invader
had a greater impact on native community composition than the
native, possibly via increased predation. However, these
conclusions were tempered by the lack of spatial and temporal
replication.
The main questions remaining to be resolved were, first, would
further advances of the invader be associated with differences in
community composition and, second, would previously invaded
communities show any recovery? Here, while applying the same
caveat as the initial River Lissan study about intrinsic problems of
pseudo-replication associated with studying community changes
in a single river (Hairston, 1989; Kelly et al., 2003), we exploit the
opportunity that the River Lissan presents to assess consequences
for macroinvertebrate community composition of this ongoing
invasion and species replacement. In particular, the two new
study reaches reported here are within 2 km upstream of the
original three reaches, a relatively short distance compared to the
tens of kilometres of stretch types detailed above. Thus, environmental
gradients are expected to be slight and unable to account
for substantial differences in macroinvertebrate communities.
The present analyses are therefore powerful in elucidating
the impacts of the invasion without confounding environmental
factors. Furthermore, if there are no large differences in physicochemical
variables in the three reaches studied at the two time
intervals, then temporal community patterns, such as recovery,
may be interpreted as features of the invasion process.
xmethods
Spatio-temporal patterns of Gammarus invasion and macroinvertebrate
community composition were assessed by sampling the
River Lissan (Northern Ireland grid ref: H820807) on 1 September
2000 and 11ñ14 August 2003. The 2000 data are those of Kelly
et al. (2003) who surveyed three 150-m reaches, each differing
in Gammarus community composition (G. pulex, mixed and
G. duebeni celticus ó hereafter designated reaches 1ñ3; Fig. 1).
In the study of Kelly et al. (2003), a range of physicochemical
parameters was recorded (n = 25 per reach for each parameter)
and macroinvertebrate samples collected (n = 25 Surber samples
per reach). Data for 2003 were collected from the same three
reaches in an identical survey. Due to the continued upstream
invasion of G. pulex, two additional 150-m reaches were surveyed (one mixed Gammarus spp. and one a G. duebeni celticus reach,
reaches 4ñ5; Fig. 1).
One-factor ?????s were used to compare each environmental
variable (see Table 1) among the five reaches in 2003 (data appropriately
transformed ó arcsine for canopy cover, log10 for
remaining variables except dissolved oxygen that was untransformed).
Mean invertebrate density and dry weight biomass
(both log10 transformed) were examined in separate two-factor
?????s with respect to ëreachí (1,2,3,4,5; factor 1) and ëinvertebrate
groupsí (Gammarus, all other species combined; factor 2,
repeated measure). One-factor ?????s examined the Shannonñ
Wiener diversity index and species richness among the five
reaches in 2003. Two-factor ?????s (ëreachí and ëtimeí as factors,
the latter as a repeated measure) examined these indices between
2000 and 2003 in those three reaches sampled in both years.
We used the community analysis programme ??-??? (McCune
& Mefford, 1995). An initial analysis of all data combined for
both years (i.e. eight data sets) was intractable and difficult to
interpret, thus we decided to conduct two separate analyses.
First, we examined spatial differences in macroinvertebrate
community structure among the five reaches that were surveyed
in 2003. Second, we examined temporal changes in community
structure in the lower three reaches that were surveyed in both
2000 and 2003. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA; Hill
& Gauch, 1980) was used to investigate the ordination of communities
and how this relates to environmental parameters
including, for the purpose of this study, the abundances of the two
Gammarus spp. (see Kelly et al., 2003). DCA orders samples (sites)
and species simultaneously along axes by an iterative reciprocal
averaging procedure that aims to maximize the correlation
between site and species scores (McCune & Mefford, 1995). We
used macroinvertebrate (excluding Gammarus) density (log10(x+ 1)
transformed) to ordinate the site/species matrix, with rare species
omitted as they can unduly influence the analysis (Jongman
et al., 1996). Coefficients of determination were calculated to
assess the percentage of variance accounted for in ordination
space by each of the ordination axes (McCune & Mefford, 1995).
Then, assessment of potentially structuring environmental factors
was made by calculating correlations between each environmental
parameter and the ordination axes scores (McCune &
Mefford, 1995). Finally, to determine if the distributions among
sites of individual taxa were related to an underlying environmental
gradient, correlations were calculated between the abundance of each
macroinvertebrate taxon and each of the ordination axes scores.
xresults
The following were similar among the five reaches surveyed
in 2003: stream width (5ñ6 m); altitude (46ñ55 m); geology
(Sherwood Sandstone); and riparian tree composition (alder,
ash, sycamore, and willow). There were no significant differences
in mean phi scale value, flow velocity, dry weight allochthonous
material, depth, percentage tree canopy cover, or dissolved oxygen
saturation among the reaches (Table 1). The only statistically
significant differences among reaches were temperature, conductivity,
and pH (Table 1). However, these statistical differences are
clearly driven by the consistent but extremely small differences
in these parameters (Table 1). We do not attach biological significance
to differences in means (largest minus smallest values)
for temperature, conductivity, and pH of 1.7 ∞C, 25 µS cm-1
, and
0.11, respectively (see Table 1). We certainly would not expect to
see significant shifts in macroinvertebrate communities over
such small ranges of values recorded for these parameters
(see also below and Discussion). Similarly, there were only small
differences in the means of these parameters between the
sampling years (means for 2000ñ03 differed by 1.3 ∞C, 28 µS cm-1
and pH 0.6; see Kelly et al., 2003).
Non-amphipod macroinvertebrate taxa occurring in the five
reaches are shown in the Appendix. Ninety-seven per cent (30/31)
of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurring in 2000
also occurred in 2003 (only Isoperla grammatica being absent),
while only 19% (7/36) OTUs (Esolus parallelipipedus, Muscidae,
Empididae, Hexatomini, Phagocata vitta, Glossiphonidae and
Ostracoda) were exclusive to the 2003 survey, implying a high degree of similarity despite differing spatial scales (i.e. five vs.
three reaches) and a 3-year sampling gap.
In both 2000 and 2003, reach 1 was dominated (i.e. occurred
at > 90% Gammarus species density) by G. pulex, although at
lower density in 2003 (Table 2). In 2003, reaches 2 and 3, the
mixed Gammarus spp. and G. duebeni celticus only reaches of
2000, respectively, had been overwhelmed by the progression of
G. pulex, with only a very few G. duebeni celticus found (Table 2).
In reach 4, the new (2003) mixed Gammarus reach, 65% of
individuals were G. pulex and, in reach 5, G. duebeni celticus
dominated with only two live G. pulex found (see Table 2).
Overall macroinvertebrate density (Gammarus + all other
OTUs) differed significantly among reaches 1 to 5 (F4,120 = 35.8,
P < 0.0001; Fig. 2). Reach 4 density was significantly lower than
reaches 2 and 3 (both P < 0.02; Fisherís protected least significant
difference test, FPLSD), while the uppermost reach 5 density was
significantly lower than reaches 1 to 4 (all P < 0.001).
Gammarus densities were significantly lower than ëotherí
macroinvertebrates (F1,120 = 617.6, P < 0.001; Fig. 2). However,
there was a significant interaction effect (F4,120 = 24.5, P < 0.001;
Fig. 2), with ëotherí macroinvertebrate density lowest in reach 1
(significantly compared to reaches 2, 3, and 4, P < 0.001, P < 0.03,
and P < 0.05, respectively), where Gammarus density was highest
(significantly compared to reaches 2, 4, and 5; P < 0.04, P < 0.001,
and P < 0.001, respectively).
Overall macroinvertebrate biomass (Gammarus + all other
OTUs) differed significantly among reaches 1 to 5 (F4,120 = 27.3,
P < 0.001; Fig. 3). In reaches 1 to 3, biomass was significantly
higher as compared with upstream reaches 4 and 5 (P < 0.04 and
P < 0.001) and lower in reach 5 than reach 4 (P < 0.001). Overall,
Gammarus biomass was not significantly different than ëotherí
macroinvertebrate biomass (F1,120 = 2.2, NS; Fig. 3), but this was
reach dependent as shown by the significant interaction effect
(F4,120 = 37.8, P < 0.001; Fig. 3). That is, G. pulex tended to occur
at greater biomass than all other invertebrates combined in
reaches (1ñ3), whereas ëotherí taxa occurred at greater biomass
in the G. duebeni celticus reach (5) with the mixed reach (4)
intermediate.
Species diversity and richness differed significantly among reaches
1 to 5 (F4,120 = 27.9 and F4,120 = 22.8, respectively, both P < 0.001;
Fig. 4a,b). Species diversity and richness were significantly lower
in the original G. pulex-dominated reach 1 than reaches 2 to 5 (all
P < 0.001; FPLSD) and significantly higher in the G. duebeni
celticus-dominated reach 5 compared to all others (all P < 0.02).
Overall, both diversity and richness were significantly higher
in reaches 1 to 3 in 2003 compared to 2000 (F1,72 = 567.5 and
F1,72 = 44.6, respectively, both P < 0.001; all pairwise comparisons
with FPLSD P < 0.001; Fig. 5a,b). Overall, diversity
and richness were significantly higher moving upstream from
reach 1 to reach 3 (F2,72 = 35.8 and F2,72 = 81.8, both P < 0.001;
all pairwise comparisons with FPLSD P < 0.001). There were
significant interaction effects (F2,72 = 5.2 and F2,72 = 4.1, both
P < 0.01), reflecting the smaller differences in means between
2000 and 2003 at the higher as compared to the lower reaches
(see Fig. 5a,b).
In the ordination of the five 2003 study reaches (Fig. 6), axis 1
explained 50% of the variation, with axis 2 a further 14%. There was a significant positive relationship between axis 1 scores and
G. duebeni celticus abundance (r = 0.6, d.f. = 123, P < 0.001),
whereas G. pulex abundance was significantly negatively correlated
with axis 1 (r = ñ0.71, d.f. = 123, P < 0.001). Several environmental
variables also had correlations in excess of 0.2 in the relationship
with axis 1 of the ordination, but with the exception of conductivity,
these were all substantially weaker than those of the Gammarus
spp. (r = ñ0.84, P < 0.001; r = 0.36, P < 0.001; r = 0.25, P < 0.01;
and r = 0.21, P < 0.05 for conductivity, depth, flow, and mean
phi, respectively, all d.f. = 123). Conductivity was also signifi-
cantly correlated with axis 2 (r = 0.41, d.f. = 123, P < 0.0001).
The difference in mean conductivity over the five reaches was,
however, extremely small (only 25 µS cm-1
; see Table 1) and, as
mentioned above, we do not attach biological relevance to
this small range. The correlation of conductivity with axes in
the ordination is clearly driven by the small but consistent
downstream increase in conductivity (Table 1), but this minor
gradient is unlikely to drive significant community change (see
also Discussion).
Therefore, the separation of the macroinvertebrate community
is most likely influenced by the Gammarus species/abundance
gradient, with samples from the current G. pulex- and G. duebeni
celticus-dominated reaches occurring in distinct areas on the
extremes of axis 1, and the mixed reach intermediate (Fig. 6).
Nine taxa (Ecdyonurus venosus, Rhithrogena semicolorata,
Chloroperla torrentium, Glossosoma sp., Ancylus fluviatalis,
Limnus volkmari (larvae), Hydropysche, Dicranota spp., and
Potamopyrgus jenkinsi) showed significant positive relationships
with axis 1 (Table 3). Thus, the distribution and abundance of
many taxa were at least partially related to the Gammarus
species/abundance gradient. For instance, as G. pulex density
decreases, then, for example, E. venosus and Hydropsyche spp.
density increases (Table 3).
In the ordination of the three reaches surveyed in both 2000
and 2003 (Fig. 7), axis 1 explained 40% of the variation, with axis
2 a further 15%. There was a significant positive correlation
between axis 1 scores and G. duebeni celticus abundance, whereas
G. pulex abundance was significantly negatively correlated with axis 1 (r = 0.46 and r = -0.37, respectively; both d.f. = 148,
P < 0.001). There was also a significant positive correlation
between axis 2 scores and G. duebeni celticus, whereas G. pulex
abundance was again significantly negatively correlated with axis
2 (r = 0.31 and r = -0.47, respectively; both d.f. = 148, P < 0.001).
Several environmental variables also had correlations in excess of
0.2 in the relationship with axis 1 of the ordination (r = ñ0.87,
P < 0.001; r = -0.89, P < 0.001; r = -0.44, P < 0.001; r = 0.31,
P < 0.001; and r = -0.26 for conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen,
flow, and canopy cover, respectively, all d.f. = 148) and axis 2
(r = 0.31, P < 0.001 and r = 0.35, P < 0.001 for conductivity and
pH, respectively). Again, however, these correlations only reflect
small differences in these parameters between years (see previous
text). Samples from the 2000 and 2003 reaches occurred in
distinct areas on the extremes of axis 1 (Fig. 7), and the 2003
samples were more tightly clustered along axis 2 compared to the
year 2000 samples, implying that the communities in these three
reaches have become more similar in the past 3 years.
For the same ordination, the relationship between the abundance
of individual macroinvertebrate taxa and the axes 1 and 2 scores
is shown in Table 3. Species abundance correlations with axis 2
scores, the axis negatively correlated with the invaderís
abundance (see Fig. 7), mirrored those in 2000 in the original
study of Kelly et al. (2003). For instance, the abundance of Baetis
rhodani, R. semicolorata, Ephemerella ignita, Protonemura meyeri,
Rhyacophila dorsalis, Hydrophilus spp., Elmis aenea (adults and
larvae), Hydropsyche spp., Chironomidae, Lumbriculidae,
and Hydracarinidae declined as G. pulex abundance increased
on axis 2 and these species were also negatively associated with
G. pulex abundance in 2000 (see Kelly et al., 2003).
xdiscussion
We have shown previously that macroinvertebrate communities
in Northern Ireland rivers change significantly in composition
over the scale of tens of kilometres (e.g. MacNeil et al., 2001;
Kelly & Dick, 2005a), with corresponding longitudinal gradients
in physicochemistry likely to be partially causal (see also Vannote
et al., 1980). However, we have also shown that G. pulex has
invaded many lower stretches of rivers, with the native G. duebeni
celticus remaining only in upper stretches (Dick et al., 1993,
1994). Thus, any differential community impacts of the invader
vs. the native are normally difficult to discern due to confounding
environmental gradients. In the present study, however, the five
reaches on the River Lissan are within a 3 km length of the river, a spatial scale over which we have not observed large gradients
in physicochemistry or concomitant community change in other
Irish rivers (e.g. see Kelly & Dick, 2005a). While we did find
statistically significant differences in three physicochemical
parameters over the five reaches of this study, the difference
between the highest and lowest means were extremely small
and unlikely to be biologically relevant (temperature 1.7 ∞C;
conductivity 25 µS cm-1
; pH 0.11). Conductivity showed the
strongest statistical difference among reaches and was also significantly
correlated with axis 1 of our community ordination.
However, the difference in mean conductivity of only 25 µS cm-1
is an order of magnitude lower than ranges of conductivity found
within sites of several rivers in Northern Ireland (Rippey, 1993),
and well within the conductivity classification ranges used
by other authors (e.g. Death & Joy, 2004). In chemical terms,
a difference of 25 µS cm-1 is equivalent to a difference of around
14 mg L-1 of NaCl (C. Hardacre, pers. comm.), and in reality
river water conductivity is determined by a number of ions.
Hence, the influence on the biological characteristics of a river of
this small difference in conductivity would be minimal. There
were similar biologically insignificant trends in physicochemistry
between sampling years. We thus conclude that major community
changes in this study area, both spatially and temporally, are
unlikely to be driven by abiotic factors (see also Kelly et al., 2003).
Rather, the distinct shifts in Gammarus species identity,
abundance, and biomass can be viewed as significant longitudinal
gradients that can reasonably be ascribed as causal in determining
broader community composition (see succeeding text).
Kelly et al. (2003), extrapolating from the 2000 data of the
River Lissan study, predicted that G. pulex would become the
dominant species in the then mixed Gammarus spp. reach and
colonize the pure G. duebeni celticus reach further upstream. The
current 2003 study confirms this prediction, with G. pulex
overwhelming the previously pure G. duebeni celticus reach and
forming a mixed species reach yet further upstream. Kelly et al.
(2003) also predicted that this process would be accompanied by
a reduction in diversity and richness of the wider macroinvertebrate
community. This prediction was also realized by our analyses of
samples in 2003. Although there was evidence of macroinvertebrate
community recovery, higher densities and biomass of
G. pulex in invaded reaches remained linked to lower richness,
diversity, and taxon-specific abundance in both 2000 and 2003 as
compared to un-invaded reaches. Indeed, the temporal recovery
in species richness and diversity is associated with a reduction in
invader abundance between 2000 and 2003. Such patterns could
arguably be due to interannual or seasonal variation, however,
we specifically controlled for the latter by sampling at similar
times among years. We further rule out seasonal effects since
Kelly & Dick (2005b) observed that invertebrate abundance
remained depressed in the invaded reach over a 6-month period,
corresponding to high abundance of G. pulex. Thus, with additional
spatial and temporal replication (see Kelly et al., 2003),
and environmental factors having negligible confounding effects,
we can conclude that invasion by G. pulex caused significant
macroinvertebrate community alterations in the River Lissan.
Predatory macroinvertebrates can reduce prey densities through
direct predation and by inducing emigration (Sih & Wooster,
1994). This may explain observed negative associations between
G. pulex abundance and that of taxa such as E. venosus, R. semicolorata,
and Hydropsychespp. For example, amphipods including G. pulex
can be highly predatory, interfere with feeding, and induce drift
behaviour in a range of invertebrates that includes ephemeropterans,
plecopterans, and trichopterans (MacNeil et al., 1997;
Haden et al., 1999; Kelly et al., 2002a,b). Differences in resource
acquisition and assimilation efficiency as compared to native
species can also drive community impacts of non-indigenous
species (Ruesink & Srivastava, 2001; Simon & Townsend, 2003),
and may explain higher densities, biomass, and impacts of G.
pulex as compared to G. duebeni celticus (MacNeil et al., 2001,
2003; Kelly et al., 2003). Additionally, given the omnivorous diet
of gammarid species, competition may also be a factor in driving
these patterns (MacNeil et al., 1997).
While macroinvertebrate communities may be extremely
resilient to disturbance events (Dernie et al., 2003; Melo et al.,
2003), the impacts of non-indigenous species may be persistent
(Ricciardi & MacIsaac, 2000). The increase in diversity and
richness in the 2003 G. pulex-dominated reaches as compared to
the same three reaches in 2000 supports the concept of community
resilience. However, this is confounded by the concomitant
decrease in the density of G. pulex in the G. pulex-dominated
reach 1, which may have reduced the effects of predation and competition. Introduced species may undergo ëboom-and-bust
cyclesí of explosive population increase followed by declines
(Simberloff & Gibbons, 2004), and thus longer term studies
are required to identify if a partial recovery is occurring in the
River Lissan.
The progression of G. pulex upstream in this river is likely
to slow as the upper stretches are approached, a pattern often
observed (see MacNeil et al., 2001). Furthermore, Stock (1993)
and Dick et al. (1997) noted that G. pulex had been unable to
expand its range in some areas where G. duebeni celticus was
dominant in Brittany and the Isle of Man. Meijering (1991)
suggested that a complex of biotic and abiotic factors influenced
the comparative population dynamics of Gammarus spp. and
warned against oversimplification when considering just one
factor. With G. pulex regarded as a predominantly lowland species
(Meijering, 1991), it is probable that physicochemical factors,
some perhaps not examined in this study but related to the
lowland or upland nature of sites, may act to favour the native, or
slow the further upstream progression of the invader. Nevertheless,
in some river systems G. pulex does occur in the headwaters,
G. duebeni celticus is completely displaced, and macroinvertebrate
communities are poorly diverse (Kelly & Dick, 2005a). That
MacNeil et al. (2001) suggested that G. pulex was more tolerant
of organic pollution and lower dissolved oxygen than G. duebeni
celticus is likely to compound such community changes. For
instance, if rivers such as the Lissan suffer increased organic
enrichment, further incursion of G. pulex into areas previously
dominated by G. duebeni celticus may occur.
The current study has implications for biological water quality
monitoring. Macroinvertebrate community composition is
currently used in the generation of biotic indices of water quality,
such as the UK Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP)
score (Wright et al., 1984), and various methods in North
America (Hilsenhoff, 1988; Reynoldson et al., 1997). We have
shown that, over a small spatial scale, significant changes in the
resident macroinvertebrate community can accompany minimal
changes in water chemistry, due to the presence of an invader.
In the River Lissan, several pollution-sensitive taxa, including
mayfly and stonefly species, declined or were displaced after
invasion by G. pulex, and their consequent loss would thus
render biotic indices inaccurate as measures of water quality
unless corrected for the invaders presence. Indeed, at a much
coarser scale, declines in such pollution-sensitive invertebrates
concomitant with invasion by G. pulex were unexplained by
water quality parameters in several Northern Irish rivers (see
MacNeil et al., 2000; Kelly & Dick, 2005a).
Understanding the mechanisms and patterns of biodiversity
decline is crucial in aquatic systems given the alarming loss rates
at local and global scales as compared to terrestrial systems (Sala
et al., 2000; Gessner et al., 2004). Amphipods are increasingly
prominent invaders of aquatic systems, affecting global patterns
of biodiversity by displacing native amphipods and altering
aquatic community structure (Ricciardi & MacIsaac, 2000; Van
der Velde et al., 2000; Dick et al., 2002). This study shows that
although such communities may recover to an extent, sustained
declines in biodiversity are likely. Biodiversity decline has
prompted investigations into species functional roles and the
consequences for both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem functioning
(Ruesink & Srivastava, 2001; Bradford et al., 2002; Giller
et al., 2004). However, linking individual species to ecosystem
functioning is confounded by abiotic factors and practicalities
of removing species assemblages from systems and measuring
effects (Townsend, 2003). Systems such as the River Lissan may
offer solutions to such problems by providing comparisons,
unhindered by confounding factors, of how local species extinction
and decline, and differential resource exploitation between
native and invading species, alter aquatic ecosystem functioning.
