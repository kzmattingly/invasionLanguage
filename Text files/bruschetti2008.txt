xabstract
In this work we evaluate the potential grazing impact of the invasive reef-forming polychaete Ficopomatus enigmaticus in a SW Atlantic coastal lagoon (Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon; 37° 40' S, 57° 23' W; Argentina). This gregarious species feeds on suspended detritus and phytoplankton. Given the large area dominated by reefs, suspension feeding by this species might reduce the lagoon phytoplankton concentration and even hinder local eutrophication. To evaluate this hypothesis in situ replicated mesocosm experiments were performed in spring 2005 and, summer and winter 2006. Mesocosms enclosing reefs and without reefs were installed and grazing intensity was measured as the difference in chlorophyll a concentration and turbidity between the reef-treatment and the treatment without reefs. Reefs of F. enigmaticus decreased the mean chlorophyll a concentration, more during summer (56% decrease) than spring (25% decrease) and winter (19% decrease). Reefs also decreased water turbidity during summer (54% decrease) and spring (23% decrease). While previous studies indicate that the physical structure of these reefs alters water flow increasing water turbidity, our evidences show that their suspension-feeding activity can counteract this effect. Water turbidity was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration, which suggests that phytoplankton grazing by F. enigmaticus decreased light attenuation through the water column, with a potential for enhancement of benthic primary productivity. Therefore, our results suggest that grazing by this polychaete affects overall estuarine primary production as well as the relative importance of planktonic and benthic carbon sources to higher trophic levels.

xintroduction
Non-indigenous species introduced mainly due to human activities are one of the major environmental and economic threats to the functioning and biodiversity of ecosystems worldwide (e.g., Vitousek et al., 1996; Cohen and Carlton, 1998; Pimentel et al., 2000). The number of introduced species continues accumulating everywhere, especially in marine and estuarine systems (e.g., Ruiz et al., 1999; Wasson et al., 2001; rensanz et al., 2002). Only a small proportion of the introduced species are likely to cause large ecological impacts (e.g., the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha in North American lakes and rivers, Hebert et al., 1989; the vascular plant Phragmites australis in the Northeastern United States, Warren et al., 2001; the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the San Francisco Bay, Nichols et al., 1990), but our understanding of the nature and magnitude of the ecological impacts is limited to a few cases.Estuaries and coastal lagoon ecosystems are habitats supporting one of the largest incidences of exotic species invasions on earth (Carlton, 1996; Ruiz et al., 1999). They are also amongst the most productive and dynamic marine habitats (Alongi, 1998; Gönenç and Wolflin, 2005). For instance, the potential for phytoplankton production in these ecosystems is higher than in other oceanic regions (Alongi, 1998; Cloern, 2001) mainly because they receive important nutrient inputs from the nearby lands (e.g., Parsons et al., 1984; Justic et al., 1995). As a consequence of high levels of biological pro- ductivity, several coastal lagoons are particularly vulnerable to eutrophication (Gönenç and Wolflin, 2005).However, suspension feeders have the potential to ameliorate eutrophication levels. Benthic suspension feeders play a considerable ecological role in shallow coastal waters because they remove phytoplankton from the water column (e.g., bivalves: Alpine and Cloern, 1992; Leach, 1993; ascidians: Petersen and Riisgård, 1992; Yahel et al., 2003; polychaetes: Davies et al., 1989; Riisgård et al., 2002). Indeed, top-down control of phytoplankton biomass by suspension feeders has been observed in several coastal (Riisgård et al., 2004; Newell, 1988; Alpine and Cloern, 1992; Davies et al., 1989) and freshwater systems (Reeders et al., 1993; Fahnenstiel et al., 1995; Caraco et al., 2006). While there are examples of changes in phytoplankton biomass and community structure in water masses passing through bivalve beds (Noren et al., 1999; Wetz et al., 2002), field experiments demonstrating phytoplankton reductions caused by suspension-feeding polychaetes are restricted to a few cases (see Riisgård et al., 1996). However, suspension-feeding polychaetes have high rates of water processing (e.g., Shumway et al., 1988; Davies et al., 1989; Riisgård and Ivarsson, 1990; Jordana et al., 2001a), which indicates that they have the potential to largely impact estuarine and shallow water ecosystems.Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (37° 40' S, 57° 23' W; Argentina) is a body of brackish water, which receives freshwater and sediment from a drainage basin of approximately 10,000 km2 (Fasano et al., 1982). Although the lagoon receives runoff loaded by nutrients from agricultural systems (Marcovecchio et al., 2005), its phytoplankton concentration and eutrophic condition is unexpectedly low (see De Marco et al., 2005). Here we hypothesize that this is due to the effect of an introduced suspension feeder – the reef-forming serpulid polychaete Fico- pomatus enigmaticus – which builds large circular reefs of up to 7 m diameter (Obenat and Pezzani, 1994, Schwindt et al., 2004b). This species, presumably native from Australia (Allen, 1953), is now a successful invader in several lagoons and estuaries of the world (e.g., Mediterranean region: Bianchi and Morri, 2001; Great Britain: Thorp, 1994; New Zealand: Read and Gordon, 1991; South America: Orensanz and Estivariz, 1972, Muniz et al., 2005). Successful invasion by F. enigmaticus in the SW Atlantic was only observed at Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (Schwindt et al., 2001). This species was first recorded at the lagoon in the early seventies (Orensanz and Estivariz, 1972). During the last decades, the reefs have augmented in density and size, covering up to 86% of the brackish portion of the lagoon with up to 370 reefs ha− 1 (Schwindt et al., 2004a). It is known that F. enigmaticus has important ecosystem engineering effects (sensu Jones et al., 1994) on other organisms via the provision of refuges (Luppi and Bas, 2002; Méndez Casariego et al., 2004) and the modification of flow and sedimentation patterns (Schwindt et al., 2001). In addition, given the amount ofindividual polychaetes per reef and their expected clearance rate (up to 8 ml mg− 1 dry mass of worm h− 1, Davies et al., 1989), this species would also have an important trophic effect on phytoplankton biomass with the potential to prevent eutrophica- tion at the lagoon. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate if the introduced reef-building polychaete F. enigmati- cus is reducing the estuarine phytoplankton biomass and thus increasing the water transparency. 

xmethods
2.1. Study areaThis study was performed at the brackish portion of the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (37° 40' S, 57° 23' W; Argentina). This lagoon is a body of brackish water of 46 km2 with an average depth of 0.6 m that receives sediment and water from creeks and artificial channels (see Fasano et al., 1982). The lagoon may be divided into an innermost shallow zone with inland influence and low tidal effect, and a zone near the inlet subject to marine tidal action (Fasano et al., 1982). Reefs of F. enigmaticus are located in the innermost zone of the lagoon (Schwindt et al., 2001, 2004a). The lagoon is an UNESCO Man Biosphere Reserve (MAB) since 1996, which adds relevance to the understanding of the ecological processes.2.2. Mesocosm experimentsTo evaluate if F. enigmaticus can reduce phytoplankton biomass and decrease water turbidity, in situ mesocosm ex- periments were performed. Experiments were conducted inde- pendently (mounted and, disassembled at the end of each period) in three seasons: spring (October to December of 2005), summer (February to March of 2006) and winter (August to September of 2006). The experiment consisted of 10 circular mesocosms (enclosures, see Fig. 1). The enclosures consisted of clear PVC crystal tubes (500 μm thickness, 95% translucence) of 100 cm diameter and 120 cm height constructed in a zone were F. enig- maticus reefs naturally occur. The upper open end (attached to a steel ring with plastic seals) was kept at about 40 cm above the maximum tidal level and the open lower border was also attached to a steel ring and buried 30 cm into the sediment. Mesocosms were randomly located 20 m from the coastline and attached to four stakes. Three equally sized reef fragments (40 × 40 cm, 30 cm height) taken from naturally occurring F. enigmaticus reefs were included in each of the five mesocosms (hereafter “reef-treatment”). The remaining 5 mesocosms were kept without reefs (hereafter “no reef-treatment”). Although reef manipulation and fragmentation might affect the survival and feeding performance of polychaetes causing an underestimation of actual reef effects, it is the only way to include similar numbers of polychaetes in the reef-treatment and serves well our purpose of comparing the effects of presence/absence of reefs on phytoplankton biomass and water turbidity. A treatment consist- ing of reefs without worms to control for the hydrodynamic effects of reefs was not considered here because water flow is expected to be negligible inside mesocosms. The height of the water column inside the mesocosms was always equal to the surrounding water. This is because due to differences of pressure between the water columns, there is water exchange through the bottom sediments of the enclosure during the tidal cycle. Given the fine grained sediments of the lagoon bottom (i.e., fine sand, silt and clay; Schwindt et al., 2004b) the water exchange actually filtered the water. Therefore the water of mesocosms was partiality renovated every day following the tidal cycle.Two methods were used for chlorophyll a determination: extracted chlorophyll with acetone and direct measurement of chlorophyll without extraction or chemical treatment (in vivo chlorophyll a). The first technique was used for contrasting of the treatments (enclosures), and the second for the correlation between chlorophyll and turbidity outside the mesocosms (see Section 2.3). Because we find a strong correlation between methods (r2 = 0.9, n = 42, P b 0.001), they were used according to availability. Each experiment lasted about 40 days and water samples were taken with a Van Dorn bottle (1 l) from mid depth inside and outside the mesocosms every 3–5 days. 500 ml of the sampled water were filtered (within 3 h after sampling) through GF/C Whatman filters (diameter = 4.7 cm, pore size = 1.2 μm). Filters were stored in a freezer (−20 °C) until subsequent analysis. Frozen filters were extracted overnight in the dark at 4 °C using 10 ml of alkaline 90% acetone. Extracts were scanned within the range of 400 to 800 nm against an acetone reference using a Shimadzu UV-2100PC spectrophotometer and 1 cm cuvettes. The concentration of pigments was estimated from absorbance readings at 665 and 750 nm (following Lorenzen, 1967). Water turbidity (Nephelometric Turbidity Unit) was determined with an Aquafluor handheld Fluorometer (Turner Design, Model 8000-01; detection range: 0.5–150 NTU).For each experiment (season), the null hypothesis of no differences in chlorophyll a concentration and turbidity between treatments was evaluated with Repeated Measures ANOVA (RM ANOVA; Zar, 1999). In cases of departure of sphericity in the repeated measures factors (Mauchley Sphericity Test), we performed the Greenhouse–Geisser Epsilon (GGE) adjustment of the degrees of freedom. This test reduced the degrees of freedom by a factor 1/(p−1) of the F-test, where p is thenumber of sampling dates (see Crowder and Hand, 1999). When a significant interaction was found, main effects of factors (i.e., treatment and time) were not considered, due to lack of inde- pendence between them (Underwood, 1997). Here and there- after, LSD multiple comparisons tests were used to identify specific differences between means after significant RM ANOVAs. Normality of the data was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test (Zar, 1999) and homoscedasticity was evaluated using the Cochran tests (Underwood, 1997).Factors such as salinity, dissolved oxygen and temperature can affect phytoplankton production (Reynolds, 1984) and may produce artifacts in the results of mesocosm experiments. To test for such artifacts, water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration and salinity were measured inside and outside mesocosms with a HORIBA Water Quality Checker (Model U- 10) during the 2006 summer experiment. The null hypothesis of no differences in these parameters between treatments was evaluated with RM ANOVA (Zar, 1999). Correlation analyses (Zar, 1999) were performed to evaluate the existence of relationships between chlorophyll a concentration in meso- cosms (both with and without reef) and the lagoon. Thus, we evaluated the correlation between the lagoon and the mesocosm water. The assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity were graphically evaluated while the assumption of normality was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test (Zar, 1999).2.3. Chlorophyll a concentration and turbidity of the lagoon waterAt each sampling date, water samples (n = 5) from outside the mesocosms were obtained to evaluate temporal variations in chlorophyll a concentration and water turbidity. The correlation between these parameters was evaluated to assess if effects of F. enigmaticus on phytoplankton biomass might cause changes in light availability in the water column. The in vivo chlorophyll a (μg l− 1 ) and turbidity were determined in an Aquafluor handheld Fluorometer (Turner Design, Model 8000-01: detec- tion range: 0.05–300 μg chl a l− 1). Cochran's test was used to evaluate homoscedasticity. Differences in chlorophyll a con- centration and, turbidity in the lagoon water between winter, spring and summer were evaluated using one way ANOVA (Zar, 1999). A simple correlation analyses (Zar, 1999) was performed to evaluate the existence of relationships between concentration of in vivo chlorophyll a and water turbidity in the different seasons. The assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity were graphically evaluated while the assumption of normality was evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test (Zar, 1999). Com- mon monotonic transformations were used to remove hetero- geneity of variances when needed (Underwood, 1997).

xresults
3.1. Mesocosm experiments3.1.1. TurbidityThe effect of reefs of F. enigmaticus on water turbiditydiffered between seasons (Fig. 2). There were differences in water turbidity between treatments during spring (RM ANOVA: F1,9=14.78 , MS=128.52, Pb0.01; Fig. 2B) and interactive effects of treatments and sampling date in summer (RM ANOVA, GGE correction factor: F2,23 = 2.97, MS = 64.11, Pb0.05; Fig. 2C), but no difference was found in winter (RM ANOVA: F1,8=0.44, MS=119.77, PN0.05; Fig. 2A). LSD multiple comparisons for the summer experiment showed decreased turbidity due to polychaete grazing in most sampling dates with the exception of February 25, and March 8 and 27, 2006 (Fig. 2C). Summer turbidity values oscillated between 2.2 and 36.9 NTU for the no reef-treatment, and 0.03 and 26.13 NTU for the treatment with reefs. In spring, there were differences in water turbidity in October 26 and 31, November 17 and December 2 of 2005, and the values oscillated between 3.7 and 28.7 NTU, and 1.91 and 28.2 NTU for the no reef and reef-treatment respectively. The average reduction of water turbidity in summer (54.7%, SD=26.1) was higher than in spring (23.8%, SD=32.8, Table 1).3.1.2. Chlorophyll aReefs of F. enigmaticus decreased chlorophyll a concentrationin winter, spring and summer (Fig. 3). The effect was notconsistent between dates, as indicated by significant interactiveeffects of treatments and dates (RM ANOVA, GGE correctionfactor: Winter: F2,12 = 4.73, MS = 35.19, P b 0.05; Spring: and 3 and 50.3 μg l− 1 for the no reef-treatment. LSD multiple comparisons for the spring experiment indicated that chlorophyll a concentration in the reef-treatment was lower than in the no reef- treatment (see Table 1) in October 17, November 10, and December 2 and 13, 2005 (Fig. 3B). During this period, chlo- rophyll a concentration fluctuated between 1 and 58.6 μg l− 1 in the reef-treatment and, 11.5 and 61.6 μg l−1 in the no reef- treatment. In the summer experiment, there were differences in the chlorophyll a concentration between treatments in all dates with the exception of February 21 and 25. Chlorophyll a concentration oscillated between 1.3 and 24 μg l− 1 in the reef-treatment and 5.4 and 47.2 μg l− 1 in the no reef-treatment (Fig. 3C). The average decrease in chlorophyll a due to the reef-treatment was 56% (SD = 10.8), 25.3% (SD = 27) and 19.6%, (SD = 16.7) in summer, spring, and winter, respectively (Table 1).3.1.3. Mesocosm effectsChlorophyll a concentration in the reef-treatment and the noreef-treatment were positively correlated with chlorophyll concentration of the lagoon water (Reef-treatment: r2=0.77, n = 138, P b 0.001; No reef-treatment: r2 = 0.79, n = 138, P b 0.001).No differences in temperature and water salinity were found between treatments during the summer experiment (RM ANOVA, temperature: F1,8=1.8, MS=0.22, PN0.05, salinity: F1,8 = 2.24, MS = 0.11, P N 0.05, Fig. 4). Only interactive effects of treatments and date on dissolved oxygen were found (RM ANOVA; F8,48=5.35, MS=6.03, Pb0.001), but significant differences (after LSD multiple comparison test) were restricted to March 17 2006, when dissolved oxygen was up to 20% lower in the mesocosms with reefs than in no reef-treatment (Fig. 4).3.2. Chlorophyll a concentration and turbidity of the lagoon waterThere were differences between seasons in the mean chlorophyll a concentration of the lagoon water (one way- ANOVA, F = 4.99, df = 2, P b 0.05). Mean chlorophyll a concentration outside mesocosms was higher in spring 2005 than in summer 2006, but no differences were found between winter 2006 and spring 2005, and winter 2006 and summer 2006 (Table 1). The higher seasonal concentrations (40.89 μg l−1, 49.94 μg l− 1, and 25.19 μg l− 1) were observed on September 26 2006, November 15 2005, and March 8 2006, respectively. In addition, no differences were found in the lagoon water turbidity between seasons during the study period (one way-ANOVA, square root transformation: F2,26=1.88, df=2, PN0.05). Peak chlorophyll a concentration coincided with maximum turbidity in the three seasons. There was a positive correlation between the in vivo chlorophyll a concentration and the turbidity of the lagoon water (winter: r2 = 0.6, df = 58, P b 0.01; spring: r2 = 0.5, df=44, Pb0.01; summer: r2 =0.4, df=93, Pb0.001; Fig. 5).

xdiscussion
Our study shows that the invasive polychaete F. enigmaticus can decrease chlorophyll a concentration and water turbidity in field mesocosm experiments. Reefs of F. enigmaticus had larger negative effects on chlorophyll a concentration and water turbidity during spring and summer. Chlorophyll a concentra- tion and turbidity of the lagoon water were also correlated irrespective of seasons. In addition, our results indicate that, F. enigmaticus can reduce the concentration of suspended particles in more than 50% in summer and 20% in spring.While a previous study indicates that the physical structure of these reefs alters water flow increasing water turbidity (Schwindt et al., 2004b), our evidences shows that the suspension feeding in this species reduce water turbidity and potentially counteracts the physical effect of reefs. In shallow systems (mean water depth b 2 m), where benthic primary production depends mostly on light availability in the water column than on nutrient supply (Cole and Cloern, 1984; Stutes et al., 2006), reduced water turbidity by suspension feeders can be sufficient to increase light penetration and enhance microphytobenthic production (Newell et al., 2002). Although the depth of this lagoon is low (average depth b 1 m), and is likely that light is not a major limiting factor, increases in water transparency via F. enigmaticus grazing during summer and spring could have an effect on benthic primary production. The productivity of benthic microalgae in shallow estuaries and lagoons is high, and depending on water depth and water clarity it can reach values closer or higher than phytoplankton production (Moncreiff et al., 1992). Stable isotope and stomach contents analysis in the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon showed that benthic microalgae are an important food source for deposit-feeding macrofauna (e.g., crabs: Martinetto et al., 2007; nematodes and polychaetes: Botto et al., 2005), and therefore these communities could be largely affected. Consequently, F. enigmaticus would increase benthic primary production and potentially affect the importance of grazing relative to detritivory as pathways for material cycling in the benthos.The rates of ingestion and clearance by F. enigmaticus are amongst the highest known for serpulid and sabellid polychaetes (see Jordana et al., 2001b), but are lower than those observed for other filter feeders (e.g., bivalves; see Dame, 1993, 1996). In the laboratory experiments and under average particle concentration of5.27mgl−1,F.enigmaticusshowedaclearancerateof8.59ml mg− 1dry mass of worm h− 1 resulting in an ingestion rate of 45.27 mg mg− 1 dry mass of worm h−1 (Davies et al., 1989). Given that there are about 3.54 × 105 m3 of living reef in this lagoon (see Luppi and Bas, 2002), and a biomass about 236 g of worm m− 3 (Obenat, 2002), the total standing stock of F. enigmaticus would be 8.37 × 1010 mg dry mass of worm. Considering the total water volume of the lagoon (about 2.76×1010 l based on 46 km2 area and 0.6 m mean depth; Fasano et al., 1982), and the above mentioned clearance rate estimated in laboratory by Davies et al. (1989), F. enigmaticus would filter the entire water volume of thelagoon in about 38 h (or 4.4 times per week). Although these calculations are rough (i.e., they assume equal filtration rates for polychaetes independently of their size or location in the reef, clearance rates that do not vary with particle concentration or flow velocity, and no water renewal at the lagoon) they well serve to approximate to the order of magnitude of F. enigmaticus effects. Considering that 86% of the brackish portion of the lagoon is currently covered by reefs (Schwindt et al., 2004a), the lower clearance rate of the polychaetes compared with bivalves could be balanced by its higher density, potentially having analogous ecosystem-level effects.There are two main hypotheses to explain the factors that control primary production in aquatic systems. One affirms that primary production is regulated by abiotic mechanisms (e.g., hydrodynamic features, nutrients fluxes, physical variability; i.e., “bottom-up” hypothesis; e.g., Nixon et al., 1986; Valiela et al., 2000), and the second states that biotic mechanisms (e.g., trophic interactions; i.e., “top-down” hypothesis; e.g., Hughes et al., 1999; Cloern, 2001) is the primary control on productivity. However, both forces usually act at the same time (see Alpine and Cloern, 1992; Valiela et al., 2004). It is known from previous studies that primary production at the Mar Chiquita lagoon is regulated by nutrient availability and by meteorological conditions (e.g., storms) that control nutrient supply via continental water input (De Marco et al., 2005; Marcovecchio et al., 2005). However, in the light of our results, joint regulation of phytoplankton biomass and primary production by nutrient supply and F. enigmaticus grazing emerges as a plausible alternative. Top-down control of phytoplankton biomass by suspension feeders is expected to increase ecosystem resiliency to changes in nutrient inputs with a concomitant potential to control eutrophication (see Herman and Scholten, 1990). The chlorophyll a concentrations found in our study were similar to those previously reported by other authors for the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (De Marco et al., 2005). Some hypereutrophic US estuaries, however, show similar levels of nutrients input (Bricker et al., 2003) than the Mar Chiquita lagoon (see Marcovecchio et al., 2005). Symptoms of hyper-eutrophica- tion (e.g., nuisance blooms, anoxia, hypoxia and macroalgae and epiphyte growth) were never observed in this lagoon, even though the required conditions exist—i.e., a relatively stable hydrological regime with low tidal amplitude (b 1 m; Lanfredi et al., 1987) and partially enclosed areas with a low hydrodynamic exchange and high nutrient inputs (see Marcovecchio et al., 2005). This indicates that F. enigmaticus might be preventing eutrophication in the lagoon via suspension feeding.In conclusion, our study shows that grazing pressure by F. enigmaticus can regulate phytoplankton biomass and primary production in this estuarine environment, likely affecting upper levels of the trophic web.
