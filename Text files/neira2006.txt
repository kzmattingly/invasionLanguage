xabstract
Many coastal habitats are being substantially altered by introduced plants. In San Francisco Bay, California, USA, a hybrid form of the eastern cordgrass Spartina alterniﬂora is rapidly invading open mudﬂats in southern and central sections of the Bay, altering habitat, reducing macrofaunal densities, and shifting species composition. The invasion has resulted in signiﬁcant losses of surface-feeding amphipods, bivalves, and cirratulid polychaetes, while subsurface feeding groups such as tubiﬁcid oligochaetes and capitellid polychaetes have been unaffected. In the present paper, we document the causes and mechanisms underlying the changes observed. Through a series of in situ manipulative experiments we examined the inﬂuence of hybrid Spartina canopy on a range of physical, chemical, and biological properties. The hybrid Spartina canopy exerted a strong inﬂuence on the hydrodynamic regime, triggering a series of physical, chemical, and biological changes in the benthic system. Relative to tidal ﬂats, water velocity was reduced in hybrid patches, promoting deposition of ﬁne-grained, organic-rich particles. The resulting changes in the sediment environment included increased porewater sulﬁde concentrations and anoxia, which led to poor survivorship of surface feeders such as bivalves, amphipods, and polychaetes. These are key taxa that support higher trophic levels including migratory shorebirds that feed on tidal ﬂats. Altered ﬂow in the Spartina canopy further contributed to changes in barnacle recruitment and resuspension of adult benthic invertebrates. Increased crab-induced predation pressure associated with Spartina invasion also contributed to changes in benthic invertebrate communities. Our results suggest that multiple physical, chemical, biotic, and trophic impacts of the Spartina invasion have resulted in substantial changes in benthic communities that are likely to have important effects on the entire ecosystem

xintroduction
Among the most serious threats to natural ecosystems has been the introduction of nonnative plants now rapidly occurring on a global scale (Drake et al. 1989, Thompson 1991, Vitousek et al. 1997, Chapin et al. 2000). Many of these plant introductions have caused substantial changes including alteration of habitat structure, extinction of native species, reduced ecosystem productivity, and changes in nutrient cycling that may have profound ecological and economic consequences (Vitousek 1986, 1990, Pimentel et al. 2000, Ayres et al. 2003). Introduced plants may cause these changes through either direct effects, for instance through alteration of habitat structure (Peterson et al. 1984, Talley and Levin 2001), or indirect effects through reductions in light levels, wind and water velocities, or alteration in nutrient availability, erosional, or depositional regimes (Fonseca et al. 1982, Eckman 1987, 1990).
Important examples of changes caused by vascular plant invasion include the introduction of Myrica faya to nitrogen-limited ecosystems in Hawaii, which resulted in fundamental changes in the functional and structural properties of the native forest (Vitousek et al. 1987). The invasion of Tamarix spp. has had similarly substantial effects in the riparian systems of the southwest United States, resulting in increased salinity, productivity, and surface litter, and reduced species diversity (Berry 1970, Gaskin and Schaal 2002). Recent invasions of freshwater plants into estuarine systems (e.g., Phragmites australis and Tamarix spp. in salt marshes) have raised new issues about plant roles in ecosystem function (Chapin et al. 1997, 2000). Vascular plants invading coastal wetlands have produced notable ecosystem changes. Major invaders include Phragmites australis in the northeast United States (Fell et al. 1998, Talley and Levin 2001, Warren et al. 2001), Hydrilla verticillata in the upper reaches of Chesapeake Bay (Posey et al. 1993), Zostera japonica in the U.S. Paciﬁc Northwest (Harrison and Bigley 1982, Larned 2003), purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria, in western North America and Canada (Thompson et al.
1987), and Spartina alterniﬂora on the west coast of the United States (Callaway and Josselyn 1992, Daehler and Strong 1996, Feist and Simenstad 2000). Plant invasions have particularly signiﬁcant impacts when colonizing otherwise unvegetated tidal ﬂats, where they reduce foraging area for shorebirds and ﬁshes, decrease light and water ﬂow, increase sedimentation rates, and reduce production of benthic algae (Posey 1988, Daehler and Strong 1996, Zipperer 1996, Stenzel et al. 2002). In San Francisco Bay, more than 790 ha of mudﬂats and marshes have been invaded by Spartina alterniﬂora and its hybrids (see Plate 1; Ayres et al. 2004, Zaremba and McGowan 2004). Reasons for the competitive success of hybrid Spartina are still not well understood, although relative to the native Spartina (S. foliosa), the hybrid produces larger, more vigorous vegetative growth, produces much greater amounts of pollen, and has a greater tidal range (Daehler and Strong 1997, Ayres et al. 1999, 2003). The speciﬁc impacts of hybrid Spartina invasion on sediment properties, macrofaunal communities, and ecosystem functioning were poorly known until recently. Mensurative studies conducted at three locations in San Francisco Bay showed variable decline in macrofaunal abundances (up to 75% reduction at one site), as well as important shifts in species composition in the hybridinvaded patches relative to tidal ﬂats (Neira et al. 2005). Surface-feeding bivalves (Gemma gemma), amphipods (Corophium spp., Grandidierella japonica), and polychaetes (Tharyx sp., Eteone dilatae) were negatively affected by invasion, while subsurface polychaetes (Heteromastus ﬁliformis, Capitella spp.) and oligochaetes (Tubiﬁcidae) were less affected or unaffected.
Such changes can alter food web function because the generally larger and more accessible surface feeders are most commonly consumed by ﬁshes and birds. The nature and extent of habitat modiﬁcation by hybrid Spartina varies with the ecosystem invaded, the age of invasion, and with hydrodynamic and physicochemical regime (Neira et al. 2005). However, the speciﬁc mechanisms underlying the observed changes remain unclear. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the link between changes induced by hybrid Spartina in the physical and chemical environment and changes in benthic communities. We have previously shown that groups of surface-feeding invertebrates, which provide food for higher trophic levels such as migratory shorebirds, decline substantially with the invasion of hybrid Spartina (Neira et al. 2005). We hypothesize that canopy structure of Spartina modiﬁes water ﬂow and sediment deposition and alters sediment characteristics in ways that will signiﬁcantly inﬂuence recruitment of juvenile invertebrates, transport of adults, and the presence of predators that are ultimately responsible for changes in macrofaunal communities. We performed a series of in situ manipulative experiments to examine the inﬂuence of hybrid Spartina canopy on water velocity, juvenile recruitment, adult advection and transport, and rates of predation as mediators of change in this benthic community.

Study site
The study site is in the city of Alameda, California, USA (San Francisco Bay) along the shoreline within the
Elsie Roemer Bird Sanctuary (3784503500 N; 12282804800 W). Spartina alterniﬂora and its hybrids ﬁrst invaded this area ;30 years ago (Ayres et al. 2003); native S. foliosa has not been present in this area since 1992 (D. R. Ayres, personal communication). The area vegetated by hybrid Spartina forms a rather continuous meadow (;10 ha) that borders the open tidal ﬂat. Sediments are coarse (;90% sand on the tidal ﬂat and ;60% sand in vegetated patches), with organic matter content usually ranging from 1.0% to 1.5% on the tidal ﬂat and from 1.7% to 3.5% in the marsh. Tidal amplitude during spring tides is typically 2.5 m with an annual maximum of nearly 3.0 m. More details of the study site are found in Neira et al. (2005).
Effects of plant canopy structure
In order to test the hypothesis that the aboveground structure of hybrid Spartina modiﬁes sediment deposition and water ﬂow in ways that inﬂuence macrofaunal community structure, we delimited 10 2 3 2 m plots located ;10 m inside the hybrid Spartina meadow (i.e., 5–7 m further into the vegetation than with our previous mensurative studies; Neira et al. 2005). Ten parallel plots were established on the tidal ﬂat adjacent to each of the vegetation plots, ;10 m from the vegetation edge (Fig. 1). Relative water ﬂow.—The effects of plant structure on relative water circulation were assayed using the gypsum dissolution technique (Doty 1971) simultaneously in all blocks and treatments. We follow the assumptions of others (Doty 1971, Howerton and Boyd 1992, Thompson and Glenn 1994) that as water velocity increases over the gypsum blocks so does turbulence and mass transfer of the gypsum to the water per unit time (g/d).
Preweighed gypsum blocks (9 cm in diameter 3 2 cm in height, ;130 g; modiﬁed after Doty [1971]) were attached to the underside of inverted L-shaped PVC pipes so that the exposed surface of the blocks faced the substrate ;10 cm above it. We deployed sets of blocks for three-, four-, and six-day intervals during April and June 2002. After each deployment, the gypsum blocks were returned to the lab, dried at 608C, and reweighed to determine mass lost since deployment. We also made single point measurements of actual water velocities using paired measurements of ﬂow with a Marsh-McBirney Flow Meter 2000 (Marsh-McBirney, Frederick, Maryland, USA) inside the vegetated area and on the open mudﬂat (at least 5 m from the edge). We measured ﬂow ;1 m from the vegetation edge (inside the meadow), because this was sufﬁcient to represent the conditions within the canopy due to the high stem density of hybrid Spartina in this area. Locating these areas within a short distance of the meadow edge allowed us to avoid disturbing nests and nestlings of the federally endangered California Clapper Rail (Rallus longirostris obsoletus). Lastly these areas also coincided with the location of our previous invasion studies (Neira et al. 2005). Velocities were measured ;15 cm above the substratum on several days. This height was great enough to avoid boundary layer effects near the substratum, but low enough to be within a zone of approximate maximum aboveground plant biomass. In order to understand the inﬂuence of hybrid Spartina on instantaneous velocity during peak ﬂow, we made ﬂow measurements over intervals of ,1 min (three 10-s measurements) during periods of maximum ebb and ﬂow tides. We repeated these measurements
over several dates in paired plots inside and outside Spartina. Sediment deposition.—To quantify the effects of aboveground structure of hybrid Spartina on short-term sediment deposition rates, we deployed Petri dish sediment traps (Reed 1992). Traps consisted of 9-cm diameter, GF/F ﬁlters (Whatman) placed on Petri dish lids (rim downwards) held ﬂush with the substratum with wire staples. Twenty sediment traps (one replicate per each of 10 blocks in hybrid and tidal ﬂat habitat) were deployed at low tide, and retrieved 24 h later. Deployments were made during two successive days in July 2002. In the laboratory, trapped sediments were gently rinsed with distilled water to remove salts and transferred onto preweighed aluminum dishes, ovendried at 608C, and weighed. Sediment deposition rate was calculated as mass deposited per trap and expressed in mgcm2d1. Deposited sediment was weighed, combusted (5008C for 4 h), and reweighed to determine organic content. In order to obtain a rough estimate of the particle size deposited on traps, sediment was wetsieved through a 63 lm mesh. Both fractions of the sample (63 lm and ,63 lm) were dried at 608C and weighed to determine percentage mud. Sediment characteristics.—We examined the inﬂuence of the hybrid Spartina invasion on sediment properties in both invaded and tidal ﬂat habitats (paired replicates in each of 10 blocks). In each block, we made measurements of porewater salinity, redox potential, temperature, porosity, water content, total organic matter (TOM), percentage mud content, and sediment chl a (a proxy for microalgal biomass). For analysis of porewater salinity, sediment (0–3 cm deep) was squeezed against Whatman ﬁlter paper inside a 10-cm3 syringe and the salinity of water passing through was measured with a hand-held refractometer. Chlorophyll a concentration was determined from small sediment cores (1.13 cm2 3 5 mm deep) spectrophotometrically according to Plante-Cuny (1973) after extraction with 90% acetone. Total organic matter was determined by mass loss of dried sediment after ignition at 5008C for 4 h. Sediment water content and sediment porosity were determined according to Buchanan (1984). Sediment temperature was recorded at 2 cm depth with a digital thermometer. Sediment redox potential was measured in the top 1 cm with a portable Mettler Toledo mV-meter (Mettler Toledo, Columbus, Ohio, USA). Sediment cores (18.1 cm2, 0–6 cm deep), collected for quantiﬁcation of macrofauna, were preserved in 8% buffered formalin with Rose Bengal stain. In the laboratory, macrofauna cores were sieved through a 300-lm mesh sieve, sorted under a dissecting microscope, and identiﬁed to the lowest taxonomic level possible.
Biological effects
Juvenile recruitment.—To examine how the modiﬁed ﬂow in hybrid Spartina could inﬂuence recruitment of benthic invertebrates, we measured recruitment of
barnacles (Balanus glandula) on shells of the introduced mussel Geukensia demissa, which is the most common mussel at this site and is typically fouled with barnacles. We assumed that the ﬂow effects of hybrid Spartina could be manifested as either reductions in the ﬂux of larvae because of reduced horizontal advection rates (Yund et al. 1991) or as reduced survival of settling larvae. Three shells of G. demissa glued individually to wooden dowels were placed in each of the 10 blocks in hybrid Spartina and on tidal ﬂats (60 dowels total) with mussels positioned ;10–20 cm above the substratum. After four weeks, we counted the total number of barnacles per shell and calculated the median number of barnacles per plot (n¼10 per habitat). Adult advection and/or transport.—To test the hypothesis that hybrid Spartina plant structure has altered the transport dynamics of benthic fauna, we deployed passive cylindrical tube traps (Butman 1986, Yund et al. 1991) made of clear polypropylene (2.7 cm wide322 cm long; aspect ratio of 8:1). Prior to outplanting, we added 15 mL of 90 g/L saline solution to the tube to prevent escape of trapped organisms, to dampen eddies and resuspension (Lau 1979, Butman 1986), and to avoid contamination concerns associated with formalin. We gently ﬁlled the remaining volume with ﬁltered seawater. On the exposed tidal ﬂats, we attached the tubes to PVC pipes above the sediment surface with cable ties. Within the hybrid Spartina habitat, tubes were inserted into the substrate leaving the tube mouth ;5 cm above the sediment surface. Previous one-day trials had shown that tubes placed ﬂush with the sediment surface rapidly became ﬁlled with sediment. We deployed 10 tubes in both tidal ﬂat and hybrid habitats (one per block) for four days and contents were preserved in 8% buffered formalin until analysis.
Sediment transplant experiment
In order to determine whether (1) changes in invertebrate community composition within hybrid Spartina habitat relative to the tidal ﬂat were due to poor survivorship of selected taxa, and (2) whether this was associated with shifts in sediment properties, we transplanted intact tidal ﬂat sediment and associated infauna to Spartina-invaded habitat. Experiments were initiated in June 2002 in the original 10 blocks. To make space for transplanted sediment in the hybrid Spartina habitat, we inserted a plastic frame into the sediment (10 cm deep) to delimit an area of 25325 cm, and the entire segment including root matrix was removed. In the adjacent open tidal ﬂat (;10 m from the vegetation edge), two plastic frames (25325 cm, 10 cm deep) were inserted into the sediment ;10 cm apart. The sediment contained in one of them was transplanted intact to the hole excavated in the vegetated habitat. The sediment section of the second frame was removed and replaced to serve as a control. After 40 and 155 days, we examined sediment properties. We collected cores (18.1 cm2, 0–6 cm deep) for analysis of sediment macrofauna,
percentage mud content (,63 lm), total organic matter, and chl a.
Predator inclusion or exclusion experiment
We investigated whether the decline of surface feeders observed in tidal ﬂats following invasion by hybrid Spartina could be due in part to increased predation pressure. Previous work has shown that densities of the European green crab (Carcinus maenas), a generalist predator introduced into San Francisco Bay ;15 years ago (Cohen et al. 1995), were approximately ﬁve times higher in hybrid Spartina meadows (mean of 3.0 crabs per trap day) than on adjacent unvegetated mudﬂats (mean of 0.6 crabs per trap day; E. D. Grosholz, unpublished data). To examine the effects of green crab predation on macrofauna following hybrid Spartina invasion, we initiated in situ exclusion and inclusion experiments on 14 July 2004. A total of eight replicate blocks were selected within hybrid Spartina habitat. We established a total of ﬁve treatments per block. Four treatments were distributed randomly in the hybrid Spartina habitat blocks, and were separated by at least 1 m from each other: (1) tidal ﬂat sediment transplanted into the hybrid zone with open cages (two sided), (2) tidal ﬂat sediment transplanted into hybrid zone with full cage and no crabs, (3) tidal ﬂat sediment transplanted into the hybrid zone with full cage with one crab, (4) unmanipulated hybrid zone sediment with full cage and no crabs. On the tidal ﬂat we created a ﬁfth treatment in which sediment was removed and replaced with no cage and no crabs. We predicted that if crab predation was contributing to changes in benthic invertebrates, tidal ﬂat sediment transplanted into the hybrid area, but protected from crab predation (Treatment 2), would retain the invertebrate assemblage typical of the tidal ﬂats. Consistent with this prediction, we would expect that the invertebrate assemblage in Treatment 1, where ambient densities of green crabs and other predators were allowed access (‘‘open’’ cages), and in Treatment 3, where a ﬁxed density of crabs were maintained, would soon converge on that of the hybrid zone. Treatment 4 was established to test for cage effects and since it involved unmanipulated sediment within hybrid Spartina, it was expected to maintain an invertebrate assemblage typical of the hybrid zone. Treatment 5 was established to test for the effects of transplanting, and since it used transplanted tidal ﬂat sediments (picked up and replaced), it was expected to maintain an invertebrate assemblage typical of tidal ﬂat areas. Cages consisted of galvanized hardware cloth (30330 3 50 cm) with 6.3-mm mesh supported on PVC pipe (1 cm in diameter) buried in the sediment with the top removable to allow measurements and manipulations. Transplant of intact tidal ﬂat sediment was made as described in the Materials and Methods: Sediment transplant experiment. Green crabs (carapace width ;40 mm) were collected in adjacent areas with minnow
traps prior to deployment in cages. The density of one crab per cage (four crabs/m2) was used based on prior studies (Cohen et al. 1995, Grosholz et al. 2000). Background samples for macrofauna and chl a were taken one day prior to the establishment of the treatments. After four weeks, we measured sediment temperature, salinity, and redox potential, and collected sediment cores for analysis of macrofauna, total organic matter (TOM), percentage mud content, chl a, porosity, and water content.
Data analysis
Paired t tests were used to test for differences among paired blocks (1–10) in macrofauna, sediment properties, and environmental variables between (1) tidal ﬂat habitats invaded and uninvaded by hybrid Spartina, and (2) transplants and controls. One-way ANOVA with a posteriori Tukey’s hsd tests was used to examine amongtreatment differences (hybrid, tidal ﬂat habitats, or predator inclusion or exclusion experiment) in sediment properties and macrofauna. Data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variances, and, where necessary, were square-root transformed. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used when transformation failed to normalize data. All parametric analyses were conducted using JMP 4.0 statistical software (SAS 2000). One standard error about the mean is presented with mean values unless otherwise indicated. All proportion data were arcsine square-root transformed. Similarities and differences in macrofaunal assemblages of the transplant experiment were explored using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS), based on BrayCurtis similarity indices. Pairwise comparisons for signiﬁcant differences in macrofaunal composition between habitats were made using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analyses were used to determine the percentage of dissimilarity (or similarity) within and between habitat assemblages (transplant and controls). MDS, ANOSIM, and SIMPER were run using PRIMER (Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Plymouth, UK; see Clarke 1993, Clarke and Warwick 1994) on square-root transformed, unstandarized data.

Physicochemical effects of plant canopy structure
Relative water ﬂow.—Mass loss from gypsum blocks was approximately two times greater in the open tidal ﬂat than in the areas invaded by hybrid Spartina for the three sampling periods (paired t test, t9 ¼ 7.96, P , 0.0001; Table 1). Flow measurements also indicated that hybrid Spartina canopy signiﬁcantly reduced ﬂow speed. In uninvaded tidal ﬂats, mean water velocity was 3.3 6 0.8 cm/s (mean 6 SE), while velocity in vegetated areas averaged ;0.8 6 0.1 cm/s. Bulk sediment deposition into short-term sediment traps was 1.4 times higher in hybrid Spartina than on tidal ﬂats (paired t test, t9¼3.7, P¼0.005; Table 1). Fine
particles comprised 45% of the sediment deposited on vegetated areas vs. ,13% of the sediment deposited on the tidal ﬂat, and were deposited at rates ﬁve times higher in vegetated areas than in the tidal ﬂat (paired t test, t9 ¼ 6.3, P ¼ 0.0001; Table 1). The ﬁne particles deposited on vegetated areas were associated with a higher sediment organic matter content (13.9% 6 0.8%) relative to the unvegetated tidal ﬂat (1.9% 6 0.4%; paired t test, t9¼18.3, P , 0.0001). Short-term organic matter deposition rates derived from sediment traps were eight times higher in the vegetated habitat than in tidal ﬂats (paired t test, t9¼18.1, P , 0.0001; Table 1). Sediment characteristics.—Sediments in hybrid Spartina had higher percentage mud than tidal ﬂat sediment (48.6% 6 5.5% and 10.7% 6 2.9%, respectively; paired t test, t9¼7.5, P , 0.0001), as well as higher total organic matter (3.7% 6 0.5% and 1.3% 6 0.2%, respectively; paired t test, t9¼4.8, P¼0.001), chl a (28.8 6 4.4 lg/g and 6.9 6 0.5 lg/g, respectively; paired t test, t9¼4.9, P ¼ 0.0008), and porosity (65.2% 6 3.3% and 48.8% 6 2.3%, respectively; paired t test, t9 ¼ 5.8, P ¼ 0.0002). Sediment in the hybrid Spartina habitat exhibited reduced conditions (redox potential Eh ¼27 6 25.4 mV) when compared with the tidal ﬂat (Eh ¼þ63.9 612.1 mV; paired t test, t9 ¼ 2.6, P ¼ 0.027). Concurrently, sulﬁde concentrations ranged between 200 and 900 lmol/L in the hybrid Spartina sediment (0– 4 cm) but were ,20 lmol/L in the tidal ﬂat (A. C. Tyler, unpublished data).
Biological changes
We observed signiﬁcantly reduced recruitment of barnacles onto mussel shells in the hybrid Spartina habitat relative to the open tidal ﬂat after eight weeks, with nine times more barnacles per shell on the tidal ﬂat than in the hybrid Spartina areas (paired t test, t9¼2.3, P¼0.035; Table 1).
In contrast, we found twice as many animals in tube traps placed in hybrid Spartina sediments as in the unvegetated tidal ﬂat (paired t test, t9 ¼2.8, P¼0.019; Table 1). About 70% of the animals in the tube traps were adult benthic macrofauna, suggesting passive (and maybe active) dispersal after resuspension. Faunal assemblages in traps differed between hybrid-invaded and tidal ﬂat habitats (analysis of similarity, ANOSIM, P ¼ 0.013). There were higher densities of Eteone californica (Phyllodocidae) and barnacle cyprids as well as lower densities of ostracods and Sphaerosyllis californiensis (Syllidae) in unvegetated tidal ﬂats relative to habitats invaded by hybrid Spartina (similarity percentage, SIMPER).
Sediment transplant experiment
After 40 days, environmental conditions and sediment properties of tidal ﬂat sediment transplanted to hybrid Spartina habitat exhibited characteristics similar to those observed previously in Spartina areas. Mud content was 40% higher in the transplanted sediment (15.3% 6 3.1%) than in the control (removed and replaced) tidal ﬂat sediment (10.2% 6 2.6%; paired t test, t9¼2.7, P¼0.024). Total organic matter was higher in the transplanted sediment (1.6% 6 0.2%) than in the tidal ﬂat treatment (1.3% 6 0.1%; paired t test, t9¼3.1, P¼0.013), as was sediment chl a (transplanted 21.8 6 5.1lg/g vs. tidal ﬂat 6.8 6 0.4 lg/g; paired t test, t9¼2.9, P¼0.020), and porosity (transplanted 58.7 6 2.8% vs. tidal ﬂat 50.8 6 1.7%; paired t test, t9¼2.5, P¼0.033). Sediment redox potential became more negative in the transplanted sediment (Eh¼75.2 6 16.4 mV) than in the tidal ﬂat treatment (Eh¼þ49.7 6 10.9 mV; paired t test, t9¼2.9, P¼0.0002). Sediment temperature did not differ between transplanted (18.4860.48C) and tidal ﬂat treatments (18.6860.78C; paired t test, t9 ¼ 0.5, P ¼ 0.623) nor did porewater salinity (36.1 6 0.2 and 35.9 6 0.3 g/L, respectively; paired t test, t9 ¼0.5, P¼0.619).
After 155 days (November 2002), environmental conditions and sediment properties were similar to those observed after 40 days. Only temperature was higher in the tidal ﬂat (17.3860.38C) relative to the transplanted treatment (15.0860.18C; paired t test, t9 ¼ 6.8, P , 0.0001). Transplanted sediments were less oxidized (Eh ¼þ25.2 6 38.5 mV) than tidal ﬂat sediments (Eh¼þ214 6 18.6 mV; paired t test, t9¼3.5, P¼0.007). Mean macrofaunal densities were lower by 50% in the transplanted tidal ﬂat sediments relative to the tidal ﬂat control treatments after 40 days (paired t test, t9¼4.1, P ¼0.003) and also after 155 days (paired t test, t9¼3.6, P ¼0.005; Fig. 2A, C, Table 2). Also, after 40 days there was a reduction in species richness per core in the transplanted sediments relative to the tidal ﬂat treatments, from 14.5 6 0.5 to 9.7 6 1.2 species (paired t test, t9 ¼ 3.4, P ¼ 0.008; Table 2). Macrofaunal assemblage composition differed between transplanted and control treatments at 40 days (51.3% dissimilarity, ANOSIM, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 2B) and 155 days (58.7% dissimilarity, ANOSIM, P¼0.001; Fig. 2D). We found poor survivorship of surface-feeding amphipods and bivalves in the transplanted sediment relative to the tidal ﬂat. Densities of tube-building amphipods Corophium spp. and Grandidierella japonica, and the bivalve Gemma gemma declined by 90.4%
(paired t test, t9 ¼ 4.9, P ¼ 0.0007), 88.7% (paired t test, t9 ¼3.3, P¼0.009), and 90.8% (paired t test, t9 ¼ 5.1, P ¼ 0.0007), respectively (Table 2). These are the same taxa exhibiting reduced densities in hybrid Spartina habitat relative to tidal ﬂat sediments (this study and Neira et al. 2005). Subsurface-deposit feeders such as tubiﬁcid oligochaetes and capitellid polychaetes were not affected in transplanted treatments after 40 days. Tubiﬁcid densities increased 28.5% but not signiﬁcantly (paired t test, t9 ¼ 0.9, P ¼ 0.377), and capitellid densities (Heteromastus ﬁliformis and Capitella spp.) did not change (paired t test, t9 ¼ 0.2, P ¼ 0.824). After 155 days, the strong decline of G. gemma persisted (97.4%; paired t test, t9¼ 5.4, P ¼ 0.0005) but was less or not evident for Corophium spp. (50% decline; paired t test, t9 ¼ 1.9, P ¼0.09) and G. japonica (12.1%; paired t test, t9¼0.2, P¼ 0.863; Table 2).
Predator inclusion or exclusion experiment
Total macrofaunal densities differed among the ﬁve treatments (ANOVA, F4,35¼15.8, P , 0.0001; Fig. 3A), and two distinct groups emerged: controls with tidal ﬂat sediments (Treatment 5) and sediments transplanted into a full cage without crabs (Treatment 2) had similar densities that were higher than sediments transplanted
into open cages (Treatment 1), into full cages with crabs (Treatment 3), and into full cages enclosing unmanipulated hybrid habitat (Tukey’s hsd, P , 0.05; Fig. 3A). Comparison of transplanted sediments into open cages (Treatment 1) with those in full cages without crabs (Treatment 2) revealed a lower organic matter content (t14¼12.14, P¼0.003) and chl a (t14¼8.06, P¼0.013) in the open cage treatments. However, no differences in light (Wilcoxon v2 ¼ 0.71, P ¼ 0.401), salinity, or temperature (both t14¼0.005, P¼0.945) were found. To test for cage effects, we also compared Treatment 1 (open, two-sided cage) with ambient hybrid sediments and found lower chl a (t14 ¼ 3.71, P ¼ 0.003), but no differences in water content (t14 ¼ 1.62, P ¼ 0.127) or porosity (t14¼1.78, P¼0.095) in the open cages relative to ambient hybrid sediment. To verify that our results
were not the result of transplant effects, we also compared the removed and replaced sediment (Treatment 5) with those of ambient tidal ﬂat sediment. No differences were found in chl a (t14 ¼ 1.99, P ¼ 0.066), water content, or porosity (both Wilcoxon v2¼1.21, P¼ 0.269). Crab presence (Treatments 1 and 3) led to lower macrofaunal densities (211.8 6 29.8 individuals per 18.1 cm2; t14¼21.6, P¼0.0004) and lower number of species (14 6 0.6 per 18.1 cm2; t14 ¼ 17.2, P ¼ 0.001) than in controls without crabs (476 6 52.4 individuals per 18.1 cm2 and 18.5 6 0.9 species per 18.1 cm2, respectively). In crab enclosures, the densities of amphipods Corophium spp. and G. japonica declined by 87.2% (t14 ¼18.6, P¼ 0.0007) and 57.5% (t14 ¼ 5.1, P ¼ 0.037), respectively, relative to the enclosure treatments without crabs, while
the densities of the bivalve G. gemma declined by 67.1% (t14 ¼7.1, P¼0.018; Fig. 3B). In addition, densities of other less abundant invertebrates, such as the subsurface deposit feeders H. ﬁliformis, Capitella spp., and a juvenile arenicolid polychaete declined by 54.5% (t14 ¼ 5.6, P¼0.033), 88.7% (t14¼9.4, P¼0.008), and 92.9% (t14 ¼ 6.4, P ¼ 0.023), respectively (Fig. 3C). Also showing declines in density were the syllid polychaete Sphaerosyllis californiensis (85.1%; t14 ¼ 35.3, P ,
0.0001) and turbellarians (81.3%; Wilcoxon v2¼8.72, P ¼0.003; Fig. 3C). We found that the declines in the partial cages with ambient crab densities (Treatment 1) were similar to those of Treatment 3 (cages with crabs). At the end of the experimental period, a visual inspection of the experimental plots with crabs revealed strongly disturbed surface sediments, with depressions up to several centimeters deep. In contrast, sediments of control cages without crabs had a smooth surface. Sediment chl a was
about two times lower in the presence of crabs (t14¼5.3, P¼0.036), as was total organic matter (t14 ¼10.2, P¼ 0.006). Redox potential was lower in enclosures with crabs (100.5 6 26.7 mV) than in those without crabs (þ40.7 6 9.3 mV; t14¼25.01, P¼0.0002).

xdiscussion
This study reveals multiple mechanisms by which invasive plants can modify coastal ecosystems. Many of the hybrid Spartina effects on benthic communities are indirect, involving changes in ﬂow and depositional environments, chemical and textural characteristics, and the nature and intensity of recruitment and predation. Below we summarize the plant inﬂuences most likely to be responsible for broad-scale changes in the benthos that have accompanied the hybrid Spartina invasion, and discuss how they reﬂect the general impacts of invasive species on ecological processes.
Physicochemical changes
Our results demonstrated strong effects of Spartina on the physical and chemical environments in both the water column and on the sediment surface. Observed reductions in peak water velocities within the hybrid Spartina canopy (70–80% lower than in adjacent unvegetated tidal ﬂat) were consistent with those documented for other Spartina marshes (e.g., Yang 1998, Christiansen et al. 2000, Leonard et al. 2002) and were most probably due to plant frictional effects (Knutson 1988, Yang 1998). Mass loss of gypsum blocks was about two times greater on the unvegetated tidal ﬂat, paralleling the reductions in ﬂow velocities. The smaller difference measured by the gypsum blocks likely reﬂects the fact that they integrate ﬂow conditions over the entire tidal cycle whereas the water velocity measurements reﬂect peak ﬂow. While gypsum blocks do not distinguish between wave motion and currents, and dissolution can be inﬂuenced by temperature and salinity, this technique remains a viable proxy for relative water circulation (Howerton and Boyd 1992, Thompson and Glenn 1994, Porter et al. 2000). Attenuation of tidal and wave energy within Spartina habitat increased sediment deposition rates and reduced particles sizes relative to unvegetated tidal ﬂats consistent with plant inﬂuences documented in S. alterniﬂora marshes (e.g., Christiansen et al. 2000), Scirpus spp. marshes (Yang 1998), Phragmites australis marshes (Leonard et al. 2002), and seagrass beds (e.g., Fonseca et al. 1982, Fonseca and Cahalan 1992). We found that sediments in the hybrid Spartina habitat had signiﬁcantly higher levels of organic matter, lower redox potential, higher porosity, higher levels of anoxia, and higher sulﬁde concentrations than those on the tidal ﬂat. Most of the sediment changes observed in this study for Spartina habitat 10 m from the water’s edge were even more severe than those described previously for Spartina habitat 1 m from the water edge (Neira et al. 2005), suggesting that harsher sediment
conditions develop as the invasion progresses. For sandy settings such as the Elsie Roemer tidal ﬂat, a change in the sedimentary chemical environment can have a greater impact on benthos than does physical disturbance (Neira and Rackemann 1996). Lower redox potential, normally associated with enhanced sulﬁde concentrations, is one of several factors reducing species richness in salt marshes (Brewer et al. 1997).
Flow-mediated biological changes
A number of our observations reﬂect invader-induced ﬂow mediation of biological patterns. There was a ninefold reduction in barnacle recruitment in the hybrid Spartina relative to the tidal ﬂat. If we normalize barnacle recruitment by ﬂux based on our gypsum block results, which suggested that the hybrid Spartina experiences six-fold less ﬂux, this indicates that the difference is not due to water movement alone. This very low recruitment in Spartina may have several nonexclusive causes: (1) lower concentrations of competent larvae within the Spartina canopy due to ﬁltering or deposition, (2) the absence of strong boundary shear, known to increase barnacle exploratory locomotion and settlement rates (Crisp 1955, Mullineaux and Butman 1991), and (3) differences in postsettlement survival between the two habitats, which may also be mediated by ﬂow and food availability. Hydrodynamic events can deposit not only sediments but also associated zoobenthos in the water column as the presence of adult benthic animals in tube traps suggests. We interpret a doubling of trap animal recovery in Spartina vegetated habitat (relative to the tidal ﬂat) as a deposition effect created by the plant canopy. Benthos on the tidal ﬂats are likely to experience higher rates of resuspension, because of the higher ﬂow velocities and greater bed stress in the absence of vegetation. However, the frictional effects of the plant canopy will result in diminished ﬂow energy (Nepf et al. 1997) and will result in the deposition and concentration of animals inside the Spartina meadow. Species common in the tube traps were more abundant on the tidal ﬂats (e.g., Eteone californica, barnacle larvae; 2.0 and 3.6 times, respectively) than in the hybrid Spartina areas, suggesting that they experienced transport from the tidal ﬂat into the Spartina canopy and entrainment within the tube traps.
Consequences of sediment transplants
The results of transplant experiments clearly supported two predictions: (1) intact tidal ﬂat sediment and associated fauna, when moved to invaded patches, would change to resemble those in vegetated habitat, and (2) the changes observed in community composition following invasion were due in part to poor survivorship of selected taxa. After 40 days and 155 days within the Spartina canopy, properties of sediment transplanted from the tidal ﬂat plots were similar to those in hybrid Spartina habitat (Neira et al. 2005 and this study). Most
of the macrofaunal density decline in transplant communities was observed within the ﬁrst 40 days and less took place in the following months (Table 2, Fig. 2A, C). The resulting loss of bivalves and amphipods was likely a response to increased organic matter deposition, which can result in hypoxic conditions and enhanced sulﬁde concentrations near or at the sediment surface (Rosenberg et al. 1991). Increased ﬁne particle sediment deposition may bury individual species like G. gemma. This bivalve is a near-surface dwelling species and is able to survive several hours when buried by sandy sediments, but survival drops ;46% when G. gemma is buried by silty sediment (Shulenberger 1971). Loss of microtopographic relief by surface deposition may result in homogenization of the habitat, with negative effects for sensitive amphipod species (Nipper et al. 1989, Werner and Zedler 2002). In contrast, capitellid polychaetes and tubiﬁcid oligochaetes cope very well in sulﬁdic sediments (e.g., Pals and Pauptit 1979).
Invader facilitates invader
Hybrid Spartina provides refuge for green crabs, themselves a recent invader, and thus enhances this predator’s inﬂuence on the benthos. Our enclosure experiments demonstrated that green crabs may modify macrofaunal communities both through the alteration of habitat structure and the top-down effect of predation. While green crab feeding activity is usually concentrated in the top few centimeters of sediment (Sherer and Reise 1982, LeCalvez 1987), crabs have also been observed digging pits deeper to extract large clams (Cohen et al. 1995). In this study, green crabs caused signiﬁcant decline in gammaridean amphipods (Corophium spp. and G. japonica) and bivalves (G. gemma), species whose densities decline during hybrid Spartina invasion (Neira et al. 2005). The intense digging activity of the green crab was further evidenced by the reduction in benthic microalgal biomass and the decline of subsurface deposit feeders (H. ﬁliformis, Capitella spp., and juvenile arenicolid polychaetes), animals otherwise well-hidden from consumers. Diatoms associated with surface sediments are susceptible to resuspension following bioturbation (Blanchard et al. 1997) and crab disturbance can reduce diatom biomass (Boyer and Fong 2005, Armitage and Fong, in press). In our experiment with Carcinus maenas, and in those of Armitage and Fong (in press) with Pachygrapsus crassipes, sediment enclosures with crabs showed reduced redox potential (i.e., anoxic sediment) relative to controls. A plausible explanation is that loss of bioturbating annelids combined with consumption of microalgae and physical disturbance could depress nearsurface oxygen concentrations and raise the redox potential discontinuity layer (Fenchel 1969).
Trophic modiﬁcations
There is evidence to suggest that the faunal changes we observed were in part the result of changes in food
availability. A separate study compared in situ uptake of 15N-labeled hybrid Spartina detritus and 13C-labeled microalgae by infaunal species at the Elsie Roemer study site (Levin et al. 2006). The greatest uptake of 15N from invasive Spartina detritus occurred mainly in annelid taxa traditionally assumed to be subsurface feeders: capitellid polychaetes and tubiﬁcid oligochaetes, taxa whose densities were generally unaffected by Spartina invasion and that showed the highest survival following transplantation into the Spartina zone (this study and Neira et al. 2005). Several of the taxa that failed to ingest signiﬁcant amounts of 15N-labeled Spartina, including amphipods (Grandidierella japonica, corophiid species), bivalves (Gemma gemma, Macoma petalum), and polychaetes (Tharyx sp.), exhibited elevated d13C signatures indicative of surface algae ingestion. Among these were species that experienced greatest reduction in density following plant invasion of the tidal ﬂat (Neira et al. 2005) and exhibited the lowest survival following transplantation into the hybrid Spartina zone (this study). The complementarity of results from stable isotope tracer studies (Levin et al. 2006) and the manipulative experiments in this study strongly supports a role for food limitation for surface feeders as one mechanism responsible for the changes witnessed in infaunal communities invaded by hybrid Spartina. The broad shifts we observed in the benthic communities of San Francisco Bay, from predominantly surface algal consumers to subsurface detritivores, are consistent with changes in the base of the food web (Levin et al. 2006); belowground plant detritus was 4.3 times more abundant in Spartina-invaded sediments than in the tidal ﬂat during our study (Neira et al. 2005). To date the most fundamental changes documented in food web structure following species invasion have resulted from top-down effects of predatory ﬁsh (Hurlbert et al. 1972), zooplankton (Spencer et al. 1991, 1999), and suspensionfeeding bivalves (Alpine and Cloern 1992). Our studies suggest that plant inﬂuences on trophic structure interact with modiﬁcations of ﬂow and sediment conditions, recruitment, and predation to transform wetland ecosystems.
Conclusions
As a result of strong physical- and chemical-mediated changes, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant declines in both diversity and density of macrofauna in hybrid Spartina areas relative to unvegetated tidal ﬂats. These results are consistent with observations in marshes dominated by S. foliosa (Levin et al. 1998), S. anglica (Jackson 1985), and S. alterniﬂora (Zipperer 1996, O’Connell 2002), but differ from existing paradigms about positive vegetation effects on macrofauna abundance and diversity (e.g., Netto and Lana 1999, Hedge and Kriwoken 2000, Pennings and Bertness 2001). Brusati and Grosholz (2006) recently found higher abundance of macroinfauna in areas vegetated by the Paciﬁc native S. foliosa in San Francisco Bay than in open mudﬂats. This
is likely due to the positive effects of aboveground structure ameliorating sediment temperatures and wave stress. In addition, the lower belowground biomass of S. foliosa relative to the hybrid does not exclude infauna as does the hybrid (Brusati and Grosholz 2006). Clearly, not all habitat systems respond in the same way to hybrid Spartina invasion; age, ﬂow regime, and native vegetation status all are important factors (Neira et al. 2005). At Elsie Roemer, hybrid Spartina acts as a refuge for predators, degrades sediment conditions, reduces food quality for surface-feeding animals, and preempts belowground habitat for infauna, thus counterbalancing the positive effects of aboveground vegetation structure on macrobenthos. From the perspective of the entire ecosystem, the loss of open tidal ﬂat may also impact species including migratory shorebirds, which continue to decline in western estuaries (Page et al. 1999). Most shorebirds will not forage in vegetated areas and are excluded from areas colonized by hybrid Spartina. At the same time, hybrid Spartina provides nesting habitat for several endangered bird species, the California Clapper Rail, and Salt Marsh Song Sparrows, although there is some question about its suitability given the reduced tidal elevations involved (Nordby et al. 2004). Understanding what tips the balance between positive and negative effects of introduced vascular plants on benthic marine systems is an important goal for future studies. By focusing on mechanisms, we can help clarify why particular species decline while others do not, ultimately facilitating prediction and interpretation of ecological change under other invasion scenarios. In closing, we note that Spartina invasion of tidal ﬂats is a widespread phenomenon: S. alterniﬂora and its hybrids are invading tidal ﬂats worldwide as are S. anglica, S. patens, and S. densiﬂora (summarized in Daehler and Strong 1996). Thus, the direct and indirect mechanisms and consequences identiﬁed here are likely to be of global signiﬁcance. Beyond Spartina, the spread of other non-indigenous vascular plants into coastal wetlands (e.g., Phragmites, Tamarix, andZostera) appears to be increasing (Ruiz et al. 1997, Adam 2002, Crooks 2002). Most of the general mechanisms we have studied for Spartina (e.g., ﬂow, sediment, chemical, recruitment, predator, and detritus alterations) apply to those other invasions. Plants are recognized as ecosystem engineers; through structural inﬂuence on habitat complexity they have cascading ecosystem-level effects (Crooks 2002). Given that native plants typically have similar physical, chemical, and biological inﬂuences, we can ask, ‘‘When does a plant introduction create a state change likely to alter ecosystem processes and functions?’’ Based on our observations for Spartina in coastal ecosystems, we predict that state changes and system restructuring will occur when the invader (1) appears in a setting where comparable structural forms are absent, thereby modifying ﬂow and associated physicochemical sedi
ment conditions (e.g., plant invasion of tidal ﬂats), (2) facilitates key consumers, whether native or invasive (e.g., C. maenas), and/or (3) introduces large quantities of a novel food source (e.g., detritus) that is used by a speciﬁc suite of organisms.
