xabstract
Invasive common reed (Phragmites aus- tralis) can rapidly form expansive, near-monotypic stands, and thereby lower plant diversity and change marsh habitat structure. Consequently, North American wetland managers often use herbicides, such as glyphosate-based AquaNeatÒ and imazypr-based Hab- itatÒ, to control its establishment and spread. However, herbiciding might indirectly affect benthic community structure by directly altering habitat structure, and habitat alterations may vary with herbicide and concen- tration. These effects may be particularly pronounced C1 year post-herbiciding when dead above-ground biomass collapses and submerges. To evaluate how herbicide-caused alterations in habitat affect key trophic linkages, we compared snail and epiphytic algal assemblages, and habitat conditions, among 20- 9 20- m replicated plots of reed treated with either AquaNeatÒ (30 % solution), HabitatÒ (5 % solution), or left herbi- cide-free (i.e., controls) in an eutrophic Lake Erie coastal marsh 1-y post-herbiciding. Both herbicides equally reduced reed above-ground growth by [90 % relative to controls. Fossaria spp. and Gyraulus parvus snails were more abundant in herbicide-treated plots than in controls, but Shannon-Wiener diversity was similar (H0 & 1.0) across treatments. All snails col- lected were pulmonates, suggesting habitat drying might be driving assemblage structure. Snails were denser in plots with metaphyton (mostly Spirogyra) than without, and metaphyton was more abundant in herbi- cide-treated plots with higher incident light levels and warmer water temperatures than in controls. Snail biomass was positively related to amount of benthic macro-organic matter but not epiphytic algal biomass, which was similar among treatments. Diatoms domi- nated algal communities in all treatments. In June, Navicula spp. was dominant in controls, whereas Nitzschia palea and Aulacoseira italic, and Nitzschia spp., were dominant in AquaNeatÒ and HabitatÒ treatments, respectively. However, algal and diatom assemblages were similar in treatments by early-July when marsh water levels significantly decreased and nitrate levels were\1 lg/L. Marsh hydrologic patterns may mediate herbiciding’s indirect effects on trophic structure.

xintroduction
Emergent plants can drive marsh ecosystem dynamics. Emergent vegetation provides trophic support to both aquatic and terrestrial organisms and affects habitat conditions for marsh biota (e.g., Laugaste and Reuna- nen 2005; Whitcraft and Levin 2007). Moreover, detrital accretion from the eventual collapse and submersion of above-ground biomass can affect system hydroperiod and geochemical patterns (Marks et al. 1994; Chambers et al. 1999). Thus, large-scale changes to emergent vegetation type or presence can potentially greatly affect marsh structural and func- tional organization.
Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. (com- mon reed), an invasive perennial grass common to many freshwater and brackish wetlands in North America, can rapidly spread to form dense, near- monocultures and displace native vegetation (Cham- bers et al. 1999; Saltonstall 2001; Back and Holomuzk 2008). Vegetative growth of below-ground rhizomes can produce stems *4–5 m tall at densities [100 stems m-2 (Marks et al. 1994; Warren et al. 2001), which significantly reduce incident light levels reach- ing the water surface (Carter et al. 1991). Natural senescence and eventual submersion of this vast growth ([1 kg m-2 year-1 [Kveˇt and Westlake 1998]) causes detrital accretion that can increase sedimentation rates and sediment anoxia (Armstrong et al. 1996), decrease hydroperiod (Templer et al. 1998), and obstruct nektonic movements (Weinsten and Balletto 1999), which together act to decrease benthic macroinvertebrate and fish diversity (Fell et al. 2003; Raichel et al. 2003). Further, nitrogen and phosphorus leaching from submerged, decomposing leaves and stems can alter algal communities (Albay and Akcaalan 2003; Gosselain et al. 2005; Laugaste and Reunanen 2005), which can indirectly affect herbivore abundance and composition and, hence, trophic economies of these systems (Bickel and Closs 2009).
These resulting changes to habitat and community structure have made reed control a priority of many wetland managers. Herbiciding is a common manage- ment practice because of its low cost and relative ease of application (Marks et al. 1994). Glyphosate-based herbicides, such as AquaNeatÒ (Riverdale Chemicals) and GlyproÒ (Dow AgroSciences) are commonly used to control reed (Marks et al. 1994), but the imazapyr- containing herbicide HabitatÒ (BASF Corporation), recently approved by the US EPA (USEPA 2003), is gaining popularity (Back and Holomuzk 2008; Mozd- zer et al. 2008; Whyte et al. 2009). Both herbicide types halt growth and cause significant (59–94 %) necrosis (browning) within 2–4 weeks post-applica- tion by inhibiting amino acid synthesis (Entrix Inc. 2003; Back and Holomuzk 2008). Browning of herbicide-treated reed does not apparently affect benthic macroinvertebrate and fish diversity or ovi- positing by adult odonates (Kulesza et al. 2008), suggesting the short-term effects of herbiciding do not affect habitat suitability and structure above and below the waterline. It is less clear how these two herbicides affect habitat conditions, and hence benthic commu- nities, over longer time periods (C1-year post-appli- cation). Both herbicides, depending on concentration, can eliminate up to *80–95 % of reed and non-target macrophytes in stands for at least 2 years post- herbiciding (Trexel-Kroll 2002; Back and Holomuzk 2008; Whyte et al. 2009). Reed elimination by glyphosates can restore trout spawning habitat in 1 year post-application (Caffrey 1996) and increase soil macroinvertebrate diversity in non-tidal wetlands until significant re-growth occurs *3 years post- application (Ailstock et al. 2001). The long-term, indirect effects of HabitatÒ on habitat conditions and benthic diversity are unknown but relevant to man- agement and restoration approaches in wetland ecosystems.
Here, we experimentally compare how a 30 % solution of AquaNeatÒ and a 5 % solution of HabitatÒ (5 %), commonly used concentrations of both herbi- cides for reed control (Giesy et al. 2000; Back and Holomuzk 2008), modify habitat conditions 1 year post-application in 400 m2 plots of reed in a Lake Erie coastal marsh. We also assess how these modifications might indirectly affect snail and algal abundance patterns. Snails were examined because they are often the dominant macrograzer of epiphytic algae in these coastal systems (Kulesza et al. 2008; Holomuzki and Klarer 2010). Specifically, our study addressed the following questions. (1) Does Phragmites density and cover differ between AquaNeatÒ- and HabitatÒ- treated plots 1 year post-application? (2) How do habitat conditions, specifically amounts of submerged benthic organic matter (BOM), water nutrient con- centrations, and incident light levels reaching the water surface, differ between herbicide-treated plots and untreated controls? (3) How is algal type and biomass in treatments related to these habitat condi- tions? (4) Do snail assemblages differ between herbicide treatments and untreated controls, and if so, how are these differences related to algal type and biomass? In Spartina-dominated salt marshes, diatom abundance, and subsequently microalgal grazer (insect larvae) abundance, increase when light pene- tration increases by emergent plant removal (clipping) (Whitcraft and Levin 2007). Thus, we similarly expected the modifying impacts of herbiciding to cause bottom-up forces to positively affect grazer abundance and diversity.

xmethods
Study marsh
The study was done in Sheldon Marsh Nature Reserve (188 ha), located *2 km west of Huron, Ohio (41°230 5900 N, 82°330 5400 W; Erie County) on Lake Erie’s south shore (Fig. 1). The marsh has a permanent *20-m wide connection to Lake Erie at the western end of its 1.8-km long barrier beach (Morang and Chader 2005). So, marsh water levels fluctuate with those of the lake. The system is eutrophic (summer PO-4 3 levels *112 lg/L), owing largely to runoff from its mainly urban watershed (Holomuzki and Klarer 2010). Water calcium levels exceed 50 mg/L (Holomuzki and Klarer 2010) and, therefore are not a limiting determinant of snail shell formation and abundance (Lodge et al. 1987).
Reed first appeared in a small isolated patch in the northeast corner of the marsh in 1998 and spread to compose *11 % of the emergent vegetation by 2001 (Back and Holomuzk 2008). Thereafter, herbiciding has contained reed to *6 % of the emergent vegeta- tion (Back and Holomuzk 2008). Dominant emergent
plants include Typha angustifolia (Narrowleaf Cat- tail), Nelumbo lutea (American Lotus), and Sagittaria latifolia (Broadleaf Arrowhead) (Back and Holomuzk 2008; Holomuzki and Klarer 2010). Summer epi- phytic algal communities are dominated by diatoms, particularly Achnanthes spp., Nitzschea palea, and Eunotia bilunaris (Holomuzki and Klarer 2010). Physella spp. is the most abundant grazing snail. Overall macroinvertebrate diversity (Shannon–Wea- ver H0 = 1.1), and % Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera (1.3 %), an indicator of system ecological health (Stewart and Downing 2008), are low (Holo- muzki and Klarer 2010), likely because of eutrophication.
Study design and herbicide treatments
A *300- 9 20-m, near-monotypic stand of reed (5-years old) was divided into 15 contiguous, 20- 9 20-m plots on 12 June 2007 (Fig. 1). Plot widths started at the submergent–emergent vegetative (mostly Nelumbo lutea [American lotus]) interface and ended just before a seasonally flooded upland area dominated mostly by Salix exigua (sandbar willow; *4–7 m tall). Plots were randomly assigned an herbicide treatment of either (1) a 30 % AquaNeatÒ solution, (2) a 5 % HabitatÒ solution, or (3) no herbicide (control) (n = 5 replicates/treatment). Her- bicides were applied to assigned plots on 14 June 2007 by applicators with backpack sprayers (*5-m spray distance) walking paths along each side of each plot.
Reed sampling
Reed abundance, characterized as live stem density and % canopy cover, was quantified on 20 June 2007 and again on 13 August 2008, *14 months after herbiciding. Reed in 0.5 m2 quadrats outlined by PVC pipe was sampled on both dates in each plot at 5-m intervals (n = 5 samples/plot/date) along a centrally- located transect that extended from the submergent– emergent vegetative edge to the plot upland boundary. Reed density was determined by stem counts, and % reed canopy cover was visually estimated in each quadrat sample. Each metric was averaged over the five samples per plot each date.
Habitat conditions in treatment plots
BOM and metaphyton
BOM was quantified to compare snail habitat and epiphyton substrate availability among treatments. BOM was collected in each plot on 24 and 30 June and 8 July 2008 in a 10- 9 10-cm quadrat outlined by PVC pipe. The quadrat was positioned 5-m into each plot from the submergent–emergent plant zone inter- face along a centrally-located transect. BOM, which included submerged fallen stems and small organic particles (C2-mm), was collected from each quadrat, placed in a ZiplocÒ bag, and stored in 95 % ethanol. Stems were cut and collected by hand, then small particles just atop the bottom were collected by dip net (2-mm mesh). Both invertebrates and metaphyton (filamentous algal mats) were removed from samples with forceps, and metaphyton presence/absence was noted. Fine inorganic sediments were removed by gently rinsing samples with tap water in a 2-mm sieve. BOM from each sample was dried at 100 °C for 24 h and weighed (±0.01 g).
Physical factors
Water samples (n = 1 per plot) for measuring nitrate (NO3-) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) con- centrations, determinants of microalgae productivity and composition (Borchardt 1996), were taken 5–10 cm below the surface from untrampled areas near plot centers on 24 June 2008. Each sample was collected in a 250 mL acid-rinsed, polypropylene bottle, immediately placed on ice in the field, refrig- erated (4 °C) in the laboratory, and analyzed within 24 h of collection. NO3- and SRP were measured by the cadmium reduction method and the ascorbic acid, two reagent method, respectively, using a spectropho- tometer (APHA 1998).
Light levels in plots were measured on 8 and 15 July 2008 to evaluate light effects on algal abundance and kind. Light measurements were recorded by a HoboÒ Light Intensity Logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, Maine, USA). Light intensity (log lum/m2) was measured simultaneously at the water surface and above the emergent plant canopy at 15 s intervals for 5 min in each plot between 0920 and 1400 h on each date. Light meters at both heights were securely placed in water-tight clear plastic canisters. Canisters on the water were allowed to float on the surface in wave-free areas, whereas canisters over canopies were strung to poles at shade-free heights (*5 m high). Light readings over the 5-min period from both water surface and canopy localities were averaged and used to calculate the % difference in light between the canopy and water surface (% light attenuation).
Water temperature and depth which can also affect snail and algal abundance (e.g., DeNicola 1996; Brown 1982) were recorded in each quadrat immedi- ately prior to BOM collections on each sample date. Temperature and depth were measured with an YSI model 95 probe and meter stick, respectively.
Snail sampling and assemblage characterization
Snails were collected from quadrats used to sample BOM (n = 45 total samples from three dates). Snails were sampled near plot centers to attempt to minimize potential edge effects posed by contiguous plots and treatments. Snails were separated from BOM by hand in the laboratory, counted, and preserved in 95 % ethanol. Identifications were to genus or species using Pennak (1989), Peckarsky et al. (1990), and Brown (1982) as primary references. After identifications, all snails from each plot were dried at 80 °C for 24 h and weighed (±0.001 g) to determine whether snail bio- mass differed among treatments.
We characterized snail assemblages in treatments using the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’) (Shan- non and Weiner 1963), density estimates, and biomass. The Shannon-Wiener formula incorporates both spe- cies richness and evenness, and is expressed as:
0X
H 1⁄4  piInpi
where pi is the proportion of individuals found in the ith species. H0 was computed for each study plot on each sampling date. Densities were calculated from snail counts in quadrats for each plot, averaged by treatment on each date, and expressed as snails 100 cm-2. Snail biomass estimates from each plot were also averaged for treatments for each sample date, and expressed as g 100 cm-2.
Epiphyton sampling and assemblage characterization
A fallen, submerged Phragmites stem, collected within 0.5 m of BOM samples on 24 June and 8 July 2008 (n = 30 total samples from both dates), was used to determine epiphyton assemblages, cell densities, and chlorophyll a (chl a) concentrations, an indicator of biomass. A 5–7 cm length of stem was cut, placed in a Whirl–pakÒ bag, and immediately transported to the laboratory. Upon arrival, length and width of each cut stem were measured to calculate surface area for algal density estimates. Algae were removed from the entire stem using the blunt end of a scalpel, rinsed with distilled water into a beaker, and diluted to a known volume. A 10-mL subsample was taken from each sample and preserved in Lugol’s solution to determine algal assemblages. Each subsample was homogenized to produce a uniform suspension, and all units from a *0.05 mL subsample were placed on a 22 9 22 cover slip and counted at 4009 magnification. A unit was equivalent to a cell for colonial and unicellular algae or a 10-lm length of filamentous algae with relatively large cells (Holomuzki and Klarer 2010). Either 250 units were counted or 1000 fields (field area = 0.1257 mm2) were viewed for each sample on both dates. To confirm accuracy of diatom
identifications, remaining portions of subsamples were cleaned in concentrated sulfuric acid, 6 % potassium dichromate, and concentrated hydrogen peroxide, air-dried on a cover slip, and mounted on a slide with HyraxÒ medium. Typically, [150 diatoms per subsample were counted and identified to genus or species using Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1986, 1988, 1991a, 1991b) or Wehr and Sheath (2003). Non- diatom algal taxa were identified using Taft and Taft (1971) and Prescott (1982). Epiphyton communities in treatments were characterized by using H0, and densities were expressed as 103 cells/100 cm2.
Chl a determinations were done on samples after subsamples were removed for algal identifications. Each sample was first vacuum-filtered through a Gelman glass-fiber filter paper (pore size 1.0 lm), then placed in 10 mL of buffered acetone at 4 °C and stored in a dark freezer for 7–10 d. Chl a concentration in an extracted subsample (3 mL) was determined by the spectrophotometric method (APHA 1998).
Statistical analyses
Reed density (log x ? 1-transformed) and percent cover (arcsine-transformed) were compared among treatments using MANOVA. Significant treatment effects were followed by one-way ANOVAs and Bonferroni pairwise comparisons.
Log-transformed dry masses of BOM were com- pared among treatments and sample dates using two- way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA. Two BOM samples were accidentally combined and were there- fore deleted from the analysis. Nutrients were com- pared among treatments using one-way ANOVAs, and % light penetration (arcsine-transformed), tempera- ture, and water depth were compared among herbicide treatments and sample dates using two-way RM ANOVAs.
Two-way RM ANOVAs were also used to compare snail and epiphyton H0-diversity, density, and biomass among treatments across dates (main effect: herbicide treatment; within subjects term: sample date) (Wil- kinson 2000). Two chl a samples from 24 June contaminated with Lemna minor (duckweed) were deleted from the analysis. Multiple regression was used to analyze the effects of epiphytic chl a and BOM on snail biomass for 24 June and 8 July, and SRP and water temperature on epiphtyon density and chl a for 24 June. BOM was not used in the latter analysis to avoid multicollinearity with SRP. Pearson’s product- moment correlation (r) was used to relate light penetration to diatom density and chl a levels on 8 July. Density and biomass were log (x ? 1)-trans- formed for analyses.
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) in PC-ORD (McCune and Mefford 2006) was attempted to relate snail assemblages to herbicide treatments. However, a high stress value (27), or no or 1-dimen- sional solutions were generated for assemblages on each date, suggesting the model was a poor fit for the data. Consequently, we did not use NMDS to charac- terize snail assemblages. However, NMDS was used to describe variation in epiphyton communities among herbicide treatments. Curtis-Bray similarity matrices were generated using densities of dominant epiphyton taxa (species present in[75 % of plots).

xresults
Reed abundance
Upon herbiciding, mean reed densities were 43, 51, and 55 stems/m2, and mean cover was 47, 49, and 53 %, in control, AquaNeatÒ-treated, and HabitatÒ- treated plots, respectively, and did not differ among treatments (MANOVA: Wilks’ k = 0.758, F4,22 = 0.817, P = 0.528). However, 14 months after herbi- ciding, stem densities and % cover significantly differed among treatments (Wilks’ k = 0.031, F4,22 = 25.744, P \ 0.001). Mean density was *109 greater, and mean cover was *209 greater, in controls (36 stems/m2; 49 %, respectively) than in herbicide- treated plots, but similar between the two herbicide treatments (Fig. 2).
Habitat conditions
BOM dry mass (grand mean ± SE: 24.4 ± 2.7 g) did not differ among treatments or sample dates, even though sample amounts from AquaNeatÒ-treated plots were relatively large on 24 June and 8 July (Fig. 3). Likewise, SRP levels on 24 June did not differ among treatments (control: 9.4 ± 7.4 lg/L [mean ± 1SE]; AquaNeatÒ-treated: 27.6 ± 14.2 lg/L; HabitatÒ- treated: 8.4 ± 3.8 lg/L) (one-way ANOVA: F2,12 = 1.307, P = 0.307) but were positively related to BOM amount (r = 0.653, P = 0.016). NO3- concentrations were low (\1 lg/L) in control and AquaNeatÒ-treated plots, and undetectable in HabitatÒ-treated plots, but similar among treatments (F2,12 = 0.600, P = 0.564).
Light attenuation was *59 greater in control plots (8 July: 25.4 ± 2.1 %; 15 July: 29.7 ± 1.3 %) than in herbicide-treated plots and was similar between her- bicide treatments (Fig. 3). Light penetration also apparently affected daytime water temperature, which was generally 1–3 °C warmer in herbicide-treated plots than in controls (Table 1). Water depths in plots declined from *18 cm in late-June to *10 cm by 8 July but were similar among treatments (Table 1).
Snail assemblage
A total of eight gastropod taxa were found on the three collection dates. Six of these, Physella spp., Fossaria spp. (likely F. obrussa and F. modicella), Promenetus umbilicatellus, Gyraulus parvus, Helisoma sp., and Stagnicola sp., comprised [90 % of all snails col- lected from plots on all dates (Fig. 4). Fossaria spp. and G. parvus were most abundant in herbicide treatments, and Physella spp., the most common snail collected, was relatively abundant in all treatments (Fig. 4). Pseudosuccinea columella was uncommon, and only one specimen of Ferrissia parallela was found over the study. H0-diversity was *1.0 and was similar across treatments and sample dates (Fig. 5).
Mean snail densities (range 7–50 snails 100 cm-2) were also similar among treatments and sample dates but were highly variable (large SEs) on 8 July in herbicide-treated plots (Fig. 5). Densities were signif- icantly greater in plots with metaphyton ( x ± 1SE: 41 ± 11 snails 100 cm-2) than without (13 ± 2 snails 100 cm-2) (RM ANOVA; treatment effect: F1,14 = 10.735, P = 0.006; date effect: F2,14 = 0.619, P = 0.546), and metaphyton mainly grew in herbi- cide-treated plots. Metaphyton (mostly Spirogyra sp.) was found in five plots on 24 June (1 control, 2 AquaNeatÒ-treated, 2 HabitatÒ-treated), five plots on 30 June (3 AquaNeatÒ-treated, 2 HabitatÒ-treated), and four plots on 8 July (2 AquaNeatÒ-treated, 2 HabitatÒ-treated). Mean snail biomass (range 0.043–0.350 g 100 cm-2) did not significantly differ among treatments and sample dates (Fig. 5), and was not related to epiphyton biomass (chl a) and BOM amount on 24 June (multiple regression: R2 = 0.258, P = 0.225) but was positively affected by BOM on 8 July (R2 = 0.651; chl a: P = 0.113; BOM: P \ 0.001).
Epiphyton community
Diatoms dominated epiphyton communities. Diatom mean relative abundance did not differ among treat- ments (RM ANOVA: F2, 10 = 0.920, P = 0.430) but did vary between sample dates (F1, 10 = 10.233, P = 0.01), ranging from 58.9 to 75.0 % on 24 June and from 75.6 to 85.3 % on 8 July. Relative abundances of common diatoms in treatments also varied with sample date. On 24 June, Navicula spp. were dominant in controls, whereas Nitzschia spp. were dominant in HabitatÒ treatments (Table 2). Both Nitzschia palea and Aulacoseira italica were domi- nant in AquaNeatÒ treatments. By 8 July, abundance rankings of diatoms were similar among treatments (Table 2).
NMDS generated a high stress value (stress = 13.17, 1-dimensional solution) for algal assemblages
on 24 June, and thus, was not used for this date. NMDS for 8 July (stress = 4.45, 2-dimensional solution) included 11 species (2 chlorophytes, 9 diatoms) and showed no clear separation of algal assemblages among treatments (Fig. 6), suggesting that algal communities were similar among treatments. Algal H0-diversity (range 1.95–2.43) was also similar across treatments and dates (Fig. 7).
Relative abundances of chlorophytes ranged, on average, from 21 to 33 % on 24 June and from 12 to 24 % on 8 July. Oedogonium sp. and Scenedesmus quadricauda were the dominant chlorophytes in treat- ments, together averaging (±1SE) 44.4 % (8.7 %) of all chlorophytes on 24 June and 48.5 % (7.6 %) on 8 July. Cyanophytes were uncommon on both dates but particularly on 8 July when they comprised, on average, \3.0 % of all algae in treatments.
Epiphyton densities (grand mean ± SE: 202 ± 28 103 cells 100 cm-2) were similar among treatments (Fig. 7). Algal biomass, as reflected in chl a concen- trations, did not significantly differ among treatments (range 4.2–41.0 lg cm-2) but did decline by *61 % from 24 June to 8 July (Fig. 7). Neither epiphyton density nor chl a level was related to SRP levels and temperature (multiple regression: both P C 0.383). However, chl a levels were marginally negatively related to light attenuation (r = –0.439, P = 0.060).

xdiscussion
Herbiciding reed indirectly affected snail and algal abundance patterns 1 year post-application. Fossaria and Gyraulus snails were more abundant in herbicide- treated plots than in untreated plots. Food quality and source might have influenced snail distributions in treatments. Gyraulus planorbids and Fossaria lym- naeids are mainly detritivores and algivores, respect- fully (Brown 1982; Kesler et al. 1986). Phragmites is relatively unpalatable to many detritivores due to its high fiber content, sclerenchymatous outer tissues, and high Acid Detergent Lignin levels (Armstrong et al. 1996; A ́ goston-Szabo ́ and Dinka 2008), which limit microbial decomposer activity and, hence, slow con- ditioning. However, early necrosis from herbiciding particularly in plots treated with fast-acting Aqua- NeatÒ (*90 % browning 2 wks post-application [Back and Holomuzk 2008]) likely expedited seasonal degradation by *3 months, which might have increased palatability. Indeed, fungal biomass is significantly greater on glyphosate-treated, early- senescent submerged reed than on naturally senescent reed (Kulesza and Holomuzki 2006). So, although BOM quantity was similar among treatments, a result likely driven by detrital export from large ice and water movements that occur in these coastal marshes in winter and spring (Kulesza and Holomuzki 2006), BOM quality may have differed.
As for algae, metaphyton abundance was greater in herbicide-treated plots than in control plots, and snails were denser in samples with metaphyton than without. Metaphyton can harbor rich diatom-dominated epiph- yton (Burkholder 1996) and trap fine BOM (Holo- muzki and Short 1988), thereby providing additional food to both grazing and detritivorous gastropods. Moreover, we found that metaphyton presence was linked to herbiciding-caused increases in light pene- tration; an expected result given green algal
abundance is positively linked to light availability (Whitcraft and Levin 2007). In turn, increased light penetration led to warmer water temperatures, which can speed snail growth (Aufderheide et al. 2006), expedite reproduction (Jigyasu and Singh 2010), and enable an individual to reach a potential size refuge from some predators sooner (Auld 2008). Further, metaphyton’s structural complexity can provide macr- oinvertebrate prey a refuge from predators (Holo- muzki and Short 1988). Thus, greatly reducing reed and non-target macrophytes by herbiciding local patches can lead to dramatic changes in habitat conditions that apparently benefit gastropods in multiple ways.
Both herbicides were equally effective in reducing reed (by *90 %) at the relatively strong concentra- tions used in the study. This finding, coupled with early herbiciding’s possible effect on improving BOM quality, suggest that managers may have more flexi- bility in the timing of applications than previously thought. To maximize reed eradication and minimize subsequent regrowth, applications are typically done in late-summer or early-autumn after seed-head for- mation when herbicide translocation to roots and rhizomes is greatest (e.g., Barnes 2003). Single applications of glyphosate or HabitatÒ at this time kill *70–98 % of a reed patch 1 year post-spraying (Caffrey 1996; Ailstock et al. 2001; Whyte et al. 2009). Thus, late-spring or early-summer applications appear equally effective and may allow managers greater flexibility in planning projects and resource needs.
Herbiciding did not affect snail densities in plots. In fact, our observed densities were high (*5–40 indi- viduals 100 cm-2) relative to densities reported in other freshwater (Mundy and Hann 1996) and salt marshes (Byers 2000; Hutchens and Walters 2006; Wells 2008). In contrast, algal densities and biomass (chl a) were uniformly low in our experimental treatments. Strong grazing pressure by snails might partly account for low algal densities and biomass. However, other factors could also limit algal abun- dance. Temporary drying, which likely occurred in study plots in early July, can significantly stunt algal growth and limit biomass and diversity (Albay and Akcaalan 2003). Water depths in plots averaged *10 cm on 8 July (Table 1), yet water depths fluctuated, on average, 12 cm per day from early-June to early-July (range 6.9–22.4 cm per day, n = 25 dates; YSI Model 6600 V2 data sonde located *200 m from plots), likely from changing wind patterns and Lake Erie seiches. Indeed, relative abundances of common diatoms were discordant among study treat- ments on 24 June but not by 8 July, when water levels were relatively low. Still, we detected a positive light– chl a relationship suggesting that the comparatively high incident light levels in herbicide-treated plots resulting from herbiciding had a stimulatory effect on epiphytic algal productivity. However, we also found low nitrate levels across treatments. N-limitation in emergent plant zones may counteract stimulatory effects that increased light levels might have on algae (Scott et al. 2005) from macrophyte removal.
Herbiciding also did not affect snail taxon richness, which was similar across treatments and similar to other cattail-dominated marshes (Lacki et al. 1990). Bickel and Closs (2009) similarly found that mollusk taxon richness and biomass do not significantly increase when physical habitat structure in a lake littoral zone is altered by cutting the invasive macro- phyte Lagarosiphon major (oxygen weed). However, Daldorph and Thomas (1991) found that pulmonate snail populations decrease when marsh macrophytes are mechanically removed. We did not detect a snail density or biomass difference in herbicide treatments relative to controls, and all snails we collected were pulmonates, belonging to the families Lymnaeidae (Fossaria spp., Stagnicola sp.), Physidae (Physella spp.), and Planorbidae (Promenetus umbilicatellus, G. parvus, Helisoma sp.). This latter result suggests that seasonal habitat drying might be key a determinant of snail assemblage and diversity in Sheldon Marsh. All study plots were completely without standing water by 1 August, as were all upland areas in the marsh (Mike Grote, Ohio Dept. Natural Resources [ODNR], personal communication). This seasonal loss of water in the marsh is a direct result of declining water levels in Lake Erie over summer (Morang and Chader 2005).
Water level may mediate the extent of herbiciding’s indirect effects on trophic conditions. Declining water levels in Lake Erie beginning in 1999 have caused many coastal wetlands to shift from open water systems dominated by phytoplankton to ones domi- nated by emergent vegetation, like reed and cattail (Trexel-Kroll 2002). An increase in emergent vegeta- tion, in turn, can decrease algal productivity and increase amounts of decaying macro-organic matter, thus shifting production/respiration ratios to \1
(Cornell and Klarer 2008). Herbiciding reed in inland wetlands with non-fluctuating water levels, or over relatively large areas in coastal wetlands, would predictably increase algal productivity significantly, and shift the system to a grazer-based food web. Examining the indirect effects of herbiciding reed in wetlands with different hydrologic and nutrient regimes, and with differently-sized emergent plant zones and spray areas, will help guide management decisions that involve potential tradeoffs between short-term disruptions to trophic and ecosystem func- tion and long-term maintenance of habitat and species diversity.
