xabstract We evaluated the response of the zooplankton
community Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron to the
disappearance of the planktivore alewife Alosa pseudoharengus
using data collected in 1991ñ1996 (pre
alewife decline) and 2009ñ2010 (post alewife
decline). Bosmina longirostris, Diaptomidae, Cyclops,
and Daphnia galeata contributed greatly to the
separation of the two time periods with Diaptomidae
and D. galeata increasing and Cyclops and B. longirostris
decreasing, although B. longirostris remained
the dominant species. Peak densities of zooplankton
occurred in early summer (June) in the 1990s and in
early fall (October) in 2009ñ2010. For the analysis of
environmental variables on a bay-wide, annual basis,
abundance of alewife, age-0 yellow perch Perca
flavescens and Bythotrephes captured much of the
variation in annual zooplankton community structure.
Abundances of Bythotrephes and age-0 yellow perch
were both higher in 2009ñ2010 than in 1991ñ1996.
Some changes such as increasing proportions of
calanoid copepods reflect a more oligotrophic community
and are potentially indicative of resourcedriven
changes rather than direct or indirect impacts of
the alewife disappearance. 


xintroduction Crustacean zooplankton occupy an intermediate position
in aquatic food webs, and therefore, zooplankton
biomass, community composition, and size structures
are sensitive to changes in both the lower food web
(i.e., bottom-up, resource driven) as well as the upper
food web (i.e., top-down, predation driven). Predation
by planktivorous fish and invertebrates can alter
zooplankton community composition, size structure,
and seasonal abundance dynamics (Brooks 1968;
Wells 1970; Lehman 1991; Mehner and Thiel 1999), while also affecting zooplankton behavior and life
history strategies (Vanni 1987; Pangle et al. 2007).
Additionally, although somewhat less well understood
than the role of planktivory, the biomass and characteristics
of food resources available to zooplankton
can influence zooplankton abundance and composition
(McNaught 1975; Lynch 1977, Vanni 1987;
Luecke et al. 1990). In turn, changes in zooplankton
biomass, community composition, seasonal dynamics,
and size structure can affect foraging success, growth,
and survival of larval, juvenile, and adult fishes
(Wu and Culver 1992; Bremigan et al. 2003; Graeb
et al. 2004).
As demonstrated by Brooks (1968), high abundances
of the planktivore alewife Alosa pseudoharengus
are generally correlated with declines in
large-bodied zooplankton, especially large cladocerans
such as Daphnia spp. (Brooks 1968; Wells 1970;
Post et al. 2008). However, the potential for alewife to
alter zooplankton communities through size-dependent
predation does not appear to be consistent across
systems. For example, alewife numbers have declined
drastically in Lake Huron, North America since 2003,
and alewife are now essentially absent from most areas
of the lake (Riley et al. 2008). However, contrary to
expectations, large-bodied daphnids declined in the
offshore areas of the lake rather than increase in
response to a release from predation (Barbiero et al.
2009). In addition, the zooplankton community shifted
toward one dominated by calanoid copepods as
cyclopoid copepods and herbivorous cladocerans
declined (Barbiero et al. 2009). Hypotheses to explain
the somewhat unexpected shifts in the zooplankton
community after the alewife collapse include potential
direct and indirect impacts of decreasing overall
productivity (Barbiero et al. 2011). Even prior to the
dramatic decline of alewives, nutrient loadings to
Lake Huron had been decreasing steadily since the
1970s and have continued to decline (Bierman et al.
1984; D. Dolan unpublished data). Moreover, in the
1990s and 2000s, dreissenid mussels (zebra Dreissena
polymorpha and quagga D. rostriformis bugensis)
invaded and expanded throughout Lake Huron
(Nalepa et al. 1995, 2007). These filter feeders
contributed to dramatic reductions in water column
light attenuation, phosphorous levels, and chlorophyll
concentrations in Saginaw Bay (Fahnenstiel et al.
1995). Further, heightened planktivory by the invasive
invertebrate Bythotrephes longimanus may exert a
structuring influence on zooplankton communities in
Lake Huron (Bunnell et al. 2011).
Saginaw Bay is a shallow, productive bay that
extends from the western shore of Lake Huron, North
America (Fig. 1). Saginaw Bay differs from the main
body of Lake Huron in a number of important aspects.
For instance, although alewife have essentially disappeared
from Saginaw Bay, overall planktivorous fish
abundance remains relatively stable compared to Lake
Huron (Fielder et al. 2000; Fielder and Thomas 2006;
M. Thomas unpublished data) where planktivore
numbers are at historic lows (Riley et al. 2008).
Invasive dreissenid mussels are found in both Saginaw
Bay and the main body of Lake Huron. However,
mussels appear to have stabilized or even decreased
recently in Saginaw Bay (Cha et al. 2011; T. Nalepa
personal communciation), whereas they are increasing
in the deep offshore waters of Lake Huron (Nalepa et al.
2007). Although nutrient loading to Saginaw Bay
decreased between the 1970s and 1990s (Cha et al.
2011) and despite the presence of dreissenid mussels,
inner Saginaw Bay remains a relatively productive
system (e.g., mean chlorophyll a = 5.6 lg/L in
2008ñ2010; J. Dyble unpublished data) in contrast to
the oligotrophic offshore regions of Lake Huron
(chlorophyll a \1.5 lg/L; Barbiero et al. 2009). In
fact, this trophic distinction between the shallow bay
and deep offshore regions of the lake could be
enhanced by dreissenid mussels, which sequester
phosphorus in the bay and restrict its transport to
offshore regions of the main lake (Cha et al. 2011).
Thus, considering these differences, it would not be
surprising if the response of the zooplankton community
to the disappearance of alewife differed in Saginaw
Bay from that observed in the main body of the lake.
Owing to the ability of alewife to structure
zooplankton communities, we hypothesized that the
abundance of large-bodied herbivorous cladocerans
(i.e., Daphnia) would increase following the disappearance
of alewife in Saginaw Bay. Secondly, despite
decreasing nutrient loads and the presence of dreissenid
mussels, Saginaw Bay remains a very productive
system as compared to open Lake Huron. Thus, we
hypothesized that there would be no shift in the
Saginaw Bay zooplankton toward a community more
indicative of oligotrophy (i.e., increased relative
importance of calanoid copepods) as has occurred in
the main basin of Lake Huron (Barbiero et al. 2011).
Finally, the seasonal pattern of zooplankton abundance 


in many lakes is characterized by a rapid increase in
late spring followed by a summer decline that can be
attributed at least partially to planktivory (Luecke et al.
1990; Rudstam et al. 1993; Mehner and Thiel 1999).
We expected this summer decline in abundance, which
occurred in Saginaw Bay in the past (Bridgeman et al.
1995), would not be as severe following the release
from alewife predation. xmethods 

Sampling took place at 5 stations in Saginaw Bay,
Lake Huron during 1991ñ1996 and 2009ñ2010. The
1991ñ1996 period represented a time when alewife
remained abundant (Fielder et al. 2000) and covered
the initial arrival and expansion of dreissenid mussels
in the bay (Nalepa et al. 1995), whereas the
2009ñ2010 period represented a time when alewife
had disappeared (M. Thomas unpublished data) and
dreissenid populations had stabilized in the bay (Cha
et al. 2011). Four stations (2, 5, 10, 14) were located in
the inner bay, and one (20) was located in the outer
bay (Fig. 1). The shallow (mean depth 5.1 m),
relatively productive inner bay is influenced by the
Saginaw River which flows into the bay on the far
west side, while the outer bay (mean depth 13.7 m) is
more strongly influenced by Lake Huron. The station
depthswere 3ñ4 m(stations 2, 5, 14), 11 m(station 10),
and 16 m (station 20). Zooplankton samples were collected monthly from
April to November in 1991, 2009, and 2010, April to
October in 1992, 1993, and 1994, May to October in
1995, and May to September in 1996. Some siteñ
month combinations were not sampled within each
year due to logistics and weather constraints. Zooplankton
samples were collected with vertical net tows
from just above bottom to surface using a 64-lm net
(0.3 mdiameter) with replicate tows taken at each site.
Zooplankton were narcotized and preserved using
sugar buffered formalin.
In the laboratory, sub-samples were taken using a
plankton splitter (1991ñ1996) or a Hensen Stempel
pipette (2009ñ2010) so that a minimum of 200
(1991ñ1996) or 600 (2009ñ2010) individuals were
counted and identified to species. For analysis, the two
replicates from a site were averaged to provide a single
estimate of zooplankton abundance and composition
for each siteñmonthñyear combination. Analysis
focused on mesozooplankton, so copepod nauplii,
rotifers, and veligers were not included in analysis. We
did not include predatory zooplankton (Bythotrephes,
Leptodora) in the analysis of the zooplankton community
because they were poorly sampled in shallow
water with the small net we used. Some species were
combined into three separate groups prior to analysis
because juveniles or adults were not differentiated
among species, i.e., (1) Diaptomidae (Leptodiaptomus
ashlandi, L. sicilis, L. minutus, Skistodiaptomus oregonensis),
(2) Cyclops (Acanthocyclopsvernalis and
Diacyclops bicuspidatus), and (3) Chydoridae. Annual
mean abundances for each species or group were
compared between periods using a t test with a
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Although we did not include predatory zooplankton
in the analysis of the zooplankton community, we did
index temporal differences in abundances. To this end,
all predatory zooplankton in samples from the two
deeper sites (Stations 10 and 20) were counted (i.e.,
without sub-sampling). An examination of predatory
zooplankton abundance from oblique tows using a
333-lm bongo net at all sites in 2009 and 2010
indicated that although the vertical net tows greatly
underestimated densities of predatory zooplankton,
tows from the deeper sites (10 and 20) provided a
reasonable estimate of their relative abundance
(S. Pothoven unpublished data).
To examine the trends in zooplankton populations
relative to environmental conditions (i.e., total
phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a, surface water temperature,
chloride (CL)), we used data collected each
month and year at each site. These water quality data
were collected as part of two larger studies of the
Saginaw Bay ecosystem; 1991ñ1996 (Nalepa et al.
1996; Johengen et al. 2000) and 2009ñ2010. Details
on water quality sampling and processing can be found
in Nalepa et al. (1996).
To examine the trends in fish abundance and
community composition, we used data from the
Michigan Department of Natural Resources bottom
trawl survey conducted throughout Saginaw Bay in
SeptemberñOctober of each year (Fielder et al. 2000;
M. Thomas unpublished data). Details on bottom trawl
surveys are available in Fielder et al. (2000). Only
trends in planktivorous fish were examined which
included the following species: alewife, rainbow smelt
Osmerus mordax, spottail shiner Notropis hudsonius,
age-0 yellow perch Perca flavescens, white perch
Morone americana, emerald shiner N. atherinoides,
and gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum.
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) was
used to visualize differences in zooplankton community
structure in two dimensions with abundance data
from each siteñmonthñyear as the input. Square root
transformed abundance data were used to create a
Bray-Curtis similarity matrix as the input for MDS.
MDS is an ordination technique that is relatively
insensitive to data distributions (i.e., non-normality
and nonlinearity) as compared to other multivariate
ordination methods (Clarke and Warwick 2001).
Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was used to
test for differences in zooplankton community
structure between time periods (1991ñ1996 and
2009ñ2010) with years nested in each period. This
approach is analogous to a nested ANOVA, with a
nonparametric permutation applied to a rank similarity
matrix of samples (Clarke and Warwick 2001).
Subsequently, a similarity percentage routine
(SIMPER) was applied to determine overall contribution
of each species to potential dissimilarity
between the two time periods. In turn, a complementary
analysis, BVSTEP, was used to find a
parsimonious combination of species to discriminate
the two periods. In BVSTEP, a similarity matrix
from the full data set is compared to subsets to find
the smallest subset that explains most of the variation
(q[0.95). That is, BVSTEP provides a search for
subsets of species whose among sample relationships effectively capture the cumulative multivariate
pattern of the full species set.
To evaluate the potential relationships between
environmental variables and the zooplankton community
structure, we used BIOENV, which calculates a
similarity matrix based on normalized Euclidean
distances for all possible combinations of environmental
data and selects those variables most highly
correlated with the original Bray-Curtis similarity
matrix using Spearman rank correlation. Two separate
BIOENV analyses were used to investigate relationships
between environmental variables and the zooplankton
community. First, data were analyzed at the
site-date scale, using log-transformed physical and
chemical environmental variables (TP, chlorophyll a,
CL, surface temperature) and site-date, enumerated
zooplankton data. Second, in order to also examine the
role of environmental variables that were not quantified
at all sites or months (i.e., predatory zooplankton
and fish), mean annual abundance of each zooplankton
species or group and log-transformed annual means of
each environmental variable (TP, chlorophyll a, CL,
surface temperature, Bythotrephes, Leptodora, and
each fish species) were used as inputs into BIOENV.
MDS, ANOSIM, SIMPER, BVSTEP, and BIOENV
were performed using Primer v5.2.9.
xresults The zooplankton community during AprilñNovember
was dominated by cladocerans in both 1991ñ1996
(75 %) and 2009ñ2010 (66 %) (Table 1). The most
abundant zooplankton during both time periods was
the small cladoceran Bosmina longirostris, which
accounted for 68 and 44 % of all zooplankters in
1991ñ1996 and 2009ñ2010, respectively. The two
most abundant copepods were Cyclops, which were
more abundant in 1991ñ1996, and Diaptomidae,
which were more abundant in 2009ñ2010. L. ashlandi,
L. minutes, L. sicilis, and S. oregonensis accounted for
45, 23, 30, and 1 % of adult Diaptomidae, respectively,
in 1991ñ1996 and 12, 37, 5, and 46 % in
2009ñ2010, respectively. All other zooplankton taxa
accounted for\10 % of the total community, except
for Daphnia galeata in 2009ñ2010 (10 %).
MDS indicated a separation of zooplankton communities
between the two time periods of 1991ñ1996
and 2009ñ2010 (Fig. 2). A stress value of 0.16
indicated that the 2-D plot was a reasonable representation
of the multidimensional distances among data.
ANOSIM confirmed the difference in zooplankton community structure between time periods
(P = 0.036, global R = 1).
Bosmina longirostris, Diaptomidae, Cyclops, and
D. galeata contributed greatly to the separation of the
two time periods ([10 % each) (SIMPER). Further
analysis with BVSTEP indicated that the top four
solutions (q[0.95) to explain the pattern of the MDS
included 6ñ7 species, and all included B. longirostris,
Diaptomidae, Cyclops, and D. galeata (Table 2). In
fact, most of the variation in the entire data set could
be explained by only including these four taxonomic
groups (q = 0.93). Further, if these 4 groups are
excluded, explanatory power decreases (q\0.52),
attesting to the importance of the four taxa in
differentiating the two time periods. The influential
species had differing trends in abundance and percent
contribution to the community between time periods,
i.e., B. longirostris and Cyclops declined, whereas
D. galeata and Diaptomidae increased (Table 1). In
total, these four species groups accounted for 92 % of
zooplankton in 1990s and 76 % in 2009ñ2010.
Peak densities of zooplankton occurred in early
summer (June) in the 1990s and in early fall (October)
in 2009ñ2010 (Fig. 3). Overall, calanoid copepods,
Daphnia spp., and other cladocerans all made larger
contributions to the community in 2009ñ2010 than in
the 1990s, whereas cyclopoid copepods and Bosminidae
made smaller contributions (Fig. 4). A ratio of
trophic status (i.e., calanoids/(cyclopoids ? cladocerans);
Gannon and Stemberger 1978) increased from
0.06 to 0.22 reflecting a shift toward a more oligotrophic
zooplankton community structure. The Daphnia
spp. population composition shifted from one
co-dominated by D. galeata (39 %) and D. retrocurva
(60 %) to one dominated mainly by D. galeata (92 %).
For the site-date scale analysis (including physical
and chemical environmental variables), TP and surface
temperature were included in each of the top four
BIOENV models, providing the best match of environmental variables with the zooplankton community
data (Table 3). However, q was relatively low
(0.24ñ0.26) for each model. Surface temperatures
were fairly similar between time periods, increasing to
peak values in July during each period followed by a
decline (Fig. 5). However, during the 2009ñ2010
period, water temperatures remained relatively warm
into the fall. TP was slightly higher in spring during
1991ñ1996 than during 2009ñ2010 (Fig. 5). During
the 1991ñ1996 period, TP increased in September and
then decreased. By contrast, TP continued to increase
in October in 2009ñ2010 to a much higher peak,
before decreasing in November.
For the analysis of environmental variables on a
bay-wide, annual basis, alewife and age-0 yellow
perch were included in each of the top four BIOENV
models, and Bythotrephes was in three of the top four
models (Table 4). These variables were related to
much of the annual variation in annual zooplankton
community structure (q = 0.81ñ0.86).
Overall, mean abundance of planktivorous fish
declined slightly between the two time periods; the
catch per unit effort (CPUE; effort equivalent to 10 min
of trawling) was 812 in 1991ñ1996 and 676 in
2009ñ2010 (Table 5). Further, relative abundances of
individual species changed between the two time
periods. Alewife CPUE declined from 171 to 0 and
declined from 21 % of the catch to 0 % (Table 5). By
contrast, age-0 yellowperchCPUEincreased from43 to
284 and their contribution to the pelagic fish catch
increased from 5 to 42 %. The contribution of rainbow
smelt to the catch also appeared to decline between time
periods, whereas the relative importance of other
planktivorous fish species remained relatively constant.
Densities of Bythotrephes (Stations 10 and 20 only)
differed among time periods (t test; P = 0.002), but
Leptodora did not (P = 0.12). Mean relative
abundance of Bythotrephes was 0.9 m-3 in
1991ñ1996 and 7.6 m-3 in 2009ñ2010. In the 1990s,
Bythotrephes were essentially absent until late summer
and early fall, but in 2009ñ2010, Bythotrephes
appeared in the spring and increased rapidly to peak
abundance in June, followed by a second higher peak
in the fall (Fig. 6). Mean relative abundance of
Leptodora was 5.6 m-3 in 1991ñ1996 and 1.8 m-3
in 2009ñ2010. Abundance of Leptodora peaked in
June during both time periods, but while a second peak 


was observed in late summer during the 1990s, such a
peak was not evident during the 2009ñ2010 period
(Fig. 6). xdiscussion
 Alewife play an important role in structuring zooplankton
communities and our study indicates that
they influence zooplankton through direct and indirect
pathways. Our observation that abundance of
D. galeata increased in Saginaw Bay after alewife
essentially disappeared is not surprising given the
negative spatial and temporal association between
Daphnia spp. and alewife observed in inland lakes
(Brooks 1968; Post et al. 2008) and in the open waters
and bays of the Laurentian Great Lakes (Wells 1970;
Evans and Jude 1986; Strus and Hurley 1992). Owing
to their increase in abundance, as well as changes in
abundances of some other species, D. galeata
increased from 1 % of the zooplankton community
to 10 % following the disappearance of alewife.
Despite the increase in abundance of this large
cladoceran, the small-bodied cladoceran Bosmina
longirostris remained the dominant species in the
bay, likely reflecting relatively high predation
demands in the system despite release from alewife
planktivory (Brooks 1968; Evans and Jude 1986; Post
et al. 2008).
An indirect impact of reduced alewife could have
been an increase in age-0 yellow perch as observed in
other systems (Shroyer and McComish 2000). Yellow
perch can exert considerable pressure on large
zooplankton prey (Mills and Forney 1983) and our
coarse analysis of environmental factors on an annual
basis indicates that both yellow perch and alewife
were strongly associated with annual patterns in
zooplankton community structure. While age-0 yellow
perch may transition from zooplankton to benthic
prey during early ontogeny (e.g., 30 mm; Wu and
Culver 1992), calanoid copepods and Daphnia spp.
constituted the majority of age-0 yellow perch diet
biomass in Saginaw Bay in 2009ñ2010 (Roswell
2011). Thus, it is perhaps somewhat surprising that
D. galeata actually increased in abundance. However,
individual yellow perch maximum consumption rates
are also lower than those of alewife for a given sized
fish (Hanson et al. 1997), so they might have a
relatively lower impact on zooplankton than alewife.
By contrast to Saginaw Bay, Daphnia spp. numbers
remained relatively stable as abundance of alewife
decreased and abundance of age-0 yellow perch
increased in the nearshore of Lake Michigan in the
1980s (Evans and Jude 1986), but the fish community
changes in Lake Michigan were not as dramatic as the
complete loss of alewife and explosion of age-0
yellow perch that occurred in Saginaw Bay.
Some changes in zooplankton community structure
appear to be indirectly rather than directly related to a
release from alewife predation. For instance, other
studies have shown that a release from planktivory is (Brooks 1968; Wells 1970). The increase in Daphnia
associated with decreased planktivory may allow
larger cladocerans such as Daphnia to outcompete
the smaller species such as Bosmina (Brooks 1968).
However, for competition to occur, food resources
would have to be limited (Dodson et al. 1976) and
chlorophyll a concentrations were similar or even
higher in 2009ñ2010 than in 1991ñ1996 (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, even though Bosmina abundance
declined and contributed to the dissimilarity in community
structure between time periods, they remained
numerically the dominant zooplankton species.
Another possibility is that reduced alewife planktivory
allowed invertebrate planktivores to increase in
abundance and feed on smaller zooplankton such as
Bosmina (Dodson et al. 1976). The coarse analysis of
annual patterns indicated that along with alewife and
yellow perch, the predatory invertebrates Bythotrephes
and Leptodora were associated with the annual
patterns of zooplankton community structure. Bythotrephes
are a large, predatory cladoceran that invaded
Lake Huron in 1984 (Bur et al. 1986). Alewife select
Bythotrephes and can control their abundance
(Pothoven and Vanderploeg 2004; Pothoven et al.
2007) so the apparent increase in Bythotrephes
abundance in 2009ñ2010 is consistent with a release
from alewife predation. Although fish abundance
remained high following the disappearance of alewife,
Bythotrephes accounted for\3 % of the zooplankton
eaten by the dominant fish species in Saginaw Bay
(i.e., age-0 yellow perch, age-0 white perch, spottail
shiner; Roswell 2011; S. Pothoven unpublished data).
Other studies have found inverse relationships
between fish and invertebrate predators and have
demonstrated that invertebrate predators can exert
considerable pressure on zooplankton (Lunte and
Luecke 1990; Herzig 1994; Wojital et al. 2004).
Bythotrephes are somewhat of an atypical invertebrate
predator because they are not necessarily confined
to eating small prey (Wahlstro®m and Westman
1999; Branstrator 2005). Their preferred prey are
generally claodocerans and they have been associated
with declines of both small and large cladocerans,
including Bosmina (Wahlstro®m and Westman 1999;
Yan et al. 2001). Further, the shift in Daphnia
composition (i.e., the loss of small D. retrocurva) is
consistent with an increase in invertebrate predation
that has been occurring in other Great Lakes
(Lehman 1991, Lehman and Ca¥ceres 1993). Although
D. galeata are eaten by Bythotrephes (Schulz and
Yurista 1999), they persist in the presence of Bythotrephes
(Lehman 1991; Lehman and Ca¥ceres 1993).
Although the Saginaw Bay ecosystem has remained
relatively productive unlike the main basin of Lake
Huron (Barbiero et al. 2011), we somewhat unexpectedly
found evidence of similar shifts in the zooplankton
community consistent with a trend toward
oligotrophication. In particular, the contribution of
calanoid copepods to the community and the zooplankton
trophic status ratio both increased. However,
it should be noted that while the proportion of calanoid
copepods increased, they still only comprised 18 % of
the zooplankton community in Saginaw Bay in
2009ñ2010 compared to Lake Huron, where they
became the dominant zooplankton group (Barbiero
et al. 2009).
Reasons for increased importance of calanoid
copepods in Saginaw Bay are somewhat unclear.
Although alewife and other planktivores consume
copepods, evidence is inconsistent as to whether a
change in alewife predation would favor one group of
copepods over the other (Strus and Hurley 1992;
Pothoven and Vanderploeg 2004). Shifts in copepod
composition favoring calanoids are often associated
with shifts in trophic condition toward oligotrophy
(Gannon and Stemberger 1978). Calanoid copepod
nauplii and adults have lower food thresholds and
metabolism than cyclopoid copepods and are able to
depress food available to cyclopoid nauplii (i.e.,
phytoplankton) and adults (i.e., microzooplankton)
under low food conditions (Soto and Hurlbert 1991;
Adrian 1997; Sommer and Stibor 2002). However,
Saginaw Bay remains a productive system despite the
presence of dreissenid mussels, which appear to have
stabilized or even declined in recent years (Cha et al.
2011).
Dreissenids are also capable of filtering microzooplankton
from the water column (Pace et al. 1998),
which could favor calanoid copepods over the cyclopoid
copepods which are carnivorous as adults. Overall
mean densities of rotifers declined between 1991ñ1996
and 2009ñ2010 (136,703 m-3 to 10,346 m-3),
although species composition remained relatively
stable (S. Pothoven unpublished data). This suggests
that food resources for cyclopoids might be depleted
following the long-term establishment of dreissenids in
Saginaw Bay. Rotifer trends in the main basin of Lake Huron did not suggest a major change in abundance,
but species composition changes indicated a shift
toward oligotrophy (Barbiero and Warren 2011).
We observed shifts in zooplankton community
structure and timing of seasonal maximum zooplankton
abundance, with peak abundance shifting from late
spring to fall. This shift is important given that the
timing of zooplankton abundance is an important
factor that helps determine larval and juvenile fish
survival and condition in the spring (Wu and Culver
1992; Bremigan et al. 2003; Graeb et al. 2004). The
pattern of a late spring increase in abundance is one
that is generally associated with Daphnia (Luecke
et al. 1990), but it appeared to characterize the
zooplankton community as a whole in 1991ñ1996 as
well. Because bottom-up forces (i.e., resource driven)
affect the initial spring zooplankton increase (Luecke
et al. 1990), one explanation for this timing change in
community structure is shifts in resource availability.
Total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations
were lower early in the year and higher later in the year
during 2009ñ2010 than in 1991ñ1996. Water temperatures
also remained relatively warm later in the year
in the latter time period, perhaps favoring zooplankton
production into the fall.
Shifts in the timing of predation pressures could
also alter the timing of peak zooplankton abundance
(Luecke et al. 1990). Changes in the fish community
composition could have shifted the timing of planktivory
pressures on fish. Based on studies in other
systems, consumption rates by small alewife peak in
fall (Stewart and Binkowski 1986), whereas daily
ration of small perch peaks in early summer and
decreases in fall (Nakashima and Leggett 1978;
Hayward et al. 1991). Therefore, the shift in fish
community structure from alewife to small yellow
perch could have favored later peaks in zooplankton
abundance during the 2009ñ2010 period. It is also
possible that an early season increase in predatory
invertebrates including Bythotrephes limited zooplankton
production early in the year. However,
Bythotrephes were also high in the fall, which is
inconsistent with this explanation. Most likely a
combination of all these factors is responsible for the
seasonal shift of the zooplankton community and the
differences between time periods.
