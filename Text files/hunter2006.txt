xabstract
 Modification of brackish marshes by nonindigenous Phragmites australis has occurred across a broad
geographical area in eastern North America. Among its effects on marsh processes, Phragmites may be increasingly
unfavorable to marsh surface fishes as its invasion progresses within an estuary. We assessed the effect of the Phragmites
invasion on resident marsh surface fishes by examining the population response of Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichog,
5-48 mm TL) and F. luciae (spotfin killifish, 5-41 mm TL) to four distinct invasion stages in three estuaries of the U.S. mid
Atlantic region (New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland). We documented precipitous declines in mean catch per unit effort of
F. heteroclitus in pit traps from natural marsh (51.6), through initial (33.8), early (12.3), and late invasion stages (2.4) across all
sites. A similar pattern was documented for F. luciae, with mean catch per unit effort in pit traps declining from natural marsh
(48.9), through initial (39.1), early (9.3), and late invasion stages (2.7). Population structure of both species also changed
somewhat across invasion stages such that we collected a narrower size range of individuals of both species from late invasion
stages. Patterns suggest that as the Phragmites invasion progresses, there is a decline in habitat function for larval and juvenile
F. heteroclitus and an increased risk of extirpation of F. luciae from brackish marshes along the east coast of the U.S.
xintroduction
Invasion of natural habitats by nonindigenous
plants varies over time and space as a result of local
physical, biological, and anthropogenic factors.
Variation in local level effects generated by the
spatial dominance of an invading plant often result
in changes to native species assemblages (Schmitz et
al. 1997; Meeking and McCarthy 1999; Martel et al.
2001), physical habitat (Posey 1988; Luken and
Thieret 1997), and ecological function (Cronk and
Fuller 1995; Gordon 1998; LeJeune and Seasteadt
2001). Over larger spatial scales, these alterations
may cause significant ecosystem shifts (Vitousek
1990), incurring both ecological and economic
costs (Pimentel 2000).
The spread of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex
Steud. (common reed, hereafter referred to as
Phragmites) across eastern North America has received
much attention because of its rate of
expansion (Chambers et al. 1999; Wilcox et al.
2003), the associated changes in biodiversity (Benoit
and Askins 1999; Meyerson et al. 2000; Talley
and Levin 2001; Silliman and Bertness 2004), the
economic resources being used for Phragmites removal
and marsh restoration (Weinstein et al.
2001), and its potential to negatively affect resident
marsh surface fishes (Able and Hagan 2000, 2003;
Able et al. 2003; Raichel et al. 2003). Although
native forms of Phragmites occur in eastern North
America, an introduced European lineage is responsible
for the aggressive displacement of native
marsh species (Saltonstall 2002).
As a consequence of the Phragmites invasion,
structural modifications of the marsh surface occur
through changes in tidal flows and sedimentation
rates, which result in a loss of surface depressions
and hydrologic alterations (e.g., increased elevation,
reduced drainage area; Windham and Lathrop
1999; Lathrop et al. 2003; Osgood et al. 2003).
Increases in plant biomass and the resulting
accumulation of plant litter also contribute to the
modification of native marshes (Talley and Levin
2001; Burdick and Konisky 2003; Rooth et al. 2003).
It is hypothesized that such alterations will become
more pronounced as the Phragmites invasion progresses
(Able et al. 2003; Lathrop et al. 2003).
Resource managers are interested in these modifications
because the marsh surface is an important
habitat for resident marsh fishes, particularly
Fundulus spp., as it provides forage and spawning
habitats for adults (Weisberg and Lotrich 1982;
Kneib and Wagner 1994), as well as nursery habitats
for the larval and juvenile stages (Kneib 1984).
Fundulus heteroclitus Linnaeus (mummichog) is ubiquitous in marsh systems along the east coast of
North America (Able and Fahay 1998) and plays
a central role in structuring marsh trophodynamics
and nutrient transport (Kneib 1986; Deegan et al.
2000; Nemerson and Able 2003). Adult F. heteroclitus
are abundant on the surface of flooded marshes
during high tides in both Phragmites and nonPhragmites
marshes (Meyer et al. 2001; Warren et
al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2002; Osgood et al. 2003).
The relative abundance of young-of-the-year Fundulus
spp. are significantly lower in Phragmites marshes
than in Spartina spp. and restored marshes (Able et
al 2003; Fell et al. 2003; Osgood et al. 2003; Raichel
et al. 2003) and may respond to changes in marsh
structure associated with the chronology of an
invasion by Phragmites.
Considerably less attention is focused on the
consequence of the Phragmites invasion on rare,
habitat-specific fauna. Fundulus luciae Baird (spotfin
killifish) is a cryptic marsh resident fish whose
distribution records indicate that habitats for all life
stages are limited (Byrne 1978; Able et al. 1983; Able
and Fahay 1998; Yozzo and Ottman 2003). Rare
collections of adult F. luciae in marsh creeks suggest
a low dispersal rate and high site fidelity (Yozzo and
Ottman 2003; Able et al. In press). All life stages of
F. luciae were absent from habitats modified by
Phragmites in New Jersey marshes (Able and Hagan
2000, 2003; Able et al. 2003), causing a concern for
the potential extirpation of this species, as invasive
Phragmites stands mature within a watershed.
Examinations of the effect of the Phragmites
invasion on the fish fauna have focused on individual
watersheds (e.g., Able and Hagan 2000,
2003; Meyer et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2002; Osgood
et al. 2003) and there have been no assessments of
regional scale effects or associated patterns among
estuaries. Because different Phragmites invasion
stages can be considered distinct habitats (Able et
al. 2003), we have the opportunity to quantitatively
study the effects of Phragmites on marsh surface
fishes by assessing the population response in stages
throughout the progression of an invasion. The
objectives of this study were to examine the effect of
Phragmites invasion on the distribution, abundance,
and size structure of young-of-the-year Fundulus spp.
in habitats characterized by four different invasion
stages (natural marsh, through initial, early and late
invasion) in three estuaries in the U.S. mid Atlantic
region (New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland).
xmethods
We chose three estuarine systems designated as
National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERR) in
the mid Atlantic region of the United States
(Kennish 2004). Specific locations were selected
within or adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau NERR at
Mullica River-Great Bay at Hog Islands, New Jersey
(39uN, 74uW); the Blackbird Creek component of
the Delaware NERR at the central portion of
Blackbird Creek on Delaware Bay, Delaware (39uN,
75uW); and the Monie Bay component of the
Chesapeake Bay NERR at Monie Creek on Chesapeake
Bay, Maryland (38uN, 75uW). Hereafter, we
will refer to these locations by state. The salinity
ranges of the three study locations were 1.2ñ11.9%
(New Jersey), 0.3ñ3.5% (Delaware), and 6.2ñ10.7%
(Maryland). Tidal range of the study locations was
approximately 1 m in New Jersey and Delaware and
0.3 m in Maryland. Surrounding areas in New Jersey
had little exposure to human development and
were relatively undisturbed. Delaware and Maryland
sites were largely surrounded by agricultural lands.
The Phragmites invasion has been well documented
at the New Jersey site, covering approximately
83% of Hog Islands in 1991 (Windham and Lathrop
1999). At the Delaware study location, Phragmites
dominates 11.1% of the marsh surface (Kennish
2004). The invasion of Phragmites has not been well
documented for the Maryland study location.
According to aerial surveys conducted between
1995 and 1997, some of the greatest extent of
Phragmites invasion in natural marshes has occurred
on the lower eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay,
Maryland (CBPAWG 2003).
To examine the effect of increasing Phragmites
dominance in the estuarine habitat we defined four
stages of Phragmites invasion (natural marsh, initial
invasion, early invasion, and late invasion), as
adapted from Able et al. (2003). Based on visual
assessments of the marsh, we characterized different
invasion stages by vegetation composition and
density, accumulated litter, and marsh surface
topography. We selected two replicates of each
invasion stage at each study location consistent with
the following definitions. Natural marsh stages are
dominated by dense, typically short-growth form
species (i.e., Spartina spp. and other native vegetation).
Surface topographies of natural marsh stage
include channels, rivulets, and depressions that
create shallow pools and a low abundance of plant
litter. Initial invasion stages have Phragmites encroaching,
with stems sparsely distributed within the
native vegetation. Depressions and channels are
features of the surface topography at this stage, and
there is limited plant litter. Early invasion stages are
dominated by Phragmites with other native species
present, but scarce. Plant litter has begun to
accumulate, resulting in the creation of a more
uniform topography, as depressions and channels
are no longer visible. Late invasion stages contain
a dense Phragmites monoculture with thick mats of plant litter, resulting in a uniform, flat topography
and little or no standing pools, rivulets, or channels.We quantified differences in vegetation structure
by sampling aboveground vegetation during the
peak of vegetative growth between August 12 and
18, 2004 (Able et al. 2003). At each invasion stage,
a 0.25 3 0.25 m quadrat was used to collect two
samples of standing vegetation and litter at each of
three distances from the marsh edge (5, 9, and
13 m). Standing vegetation was identified to the
lowest possible taxa and separated into live and
dead plant material. In the field, individual stems
were counted for live and dead plants to determine
stem density. We also measured the height of live
stems of the dominant species. In the laboratory,
plant material was dried at 50ñ60uC to a constant
weight to estimate aboveground biomass for each
species and total litter biomass.
Physical parameters were monitored on each
sampling date. Water temperature (uC) and salinity
(%) were recorded from a pit trap (see below)
using a YSI Model 85. Maximum flood depth was
measured with flood gauges (as used in Able and
Hagan 2003, Able et al. 2003) installed 5 and 13 m
from the marsh edge. A flood gauge consisted of 20
plastic vials attached to a wooden stake at 3-cm
intervals. Flood gauges were driven into the marsh
surface so that the bottom of the lowest vial touched
the substrate. On each sampling date, flood gauges
were emptied before the daytime high tide. Once
the tide receded from the marsh surface, the
highest filled vial determined the maximum flood
depth over one tidal period. We also assessed the
abundance of standing water at each invasion stage.
Immediately after the daytime high tide receded, we
estimated mean percent standing water on the
marsh surface (i.e., .1 mm depth) from eight
randomly placed quadrats (0.25 3 0.25 m).traps (rectangular glass dishes, 27.5 3 17.5 3
3.7 cm). Pit traps mimic shallow depressions typically
used by larval and juvenile Fundulus spp.
during times when the marsh surface is not flooded
(Kneib 1997; Able and Hagan 2000, 2003). At each
invasion stage, we established two parallel pit trap
transects, approximately 1 m apart. Pit traps were
installed flush with the marsh surface at three
distances (5, 9, and 13 m) from the marsh edge and
were secured with 0.5-m iron hooks. An access path
was created at least 1 m away from the pit trap array
and was used only during the retrieval of samples.
We examined fish abundance patterns over the
regional peak periods of reproduction and larval
and juvenile abundance for Fundulus spp. (Able and
Fahay 1998) by making collections on or as close as
possible to the peak daytime spring tide at each
study location. We sampled on a biweekly basis from
May 18 to August 2, and on a monthly basis from
August 30 to October 4, in 2004. On each sampling
event, collections of pit traps were made on two
occasions: prior to and after the daytime high tide
(total individual pit trap samples: natural 456, initial
440, early 440, late 373). Pit traps were completely
emptied into bags before flooding at high tide,
sorted immediately, and preserved with 95% ethanol.
This collection represented the cumulative
period between the sampling dates at each location
(referred to as the cumulative sample). Cumulative
pit trap sampling may provide low tide refugia to
fishes between sampling events, allowing animals to
accumulate in these traps over time (Able et al.
2003). Once this sample was collected, the pit traps
were redeployed. After water had flooded and then
receded from the marsh surface, contents of the pit
traps were collected on the next low tide in the
same manner as the cumulative sample and kept in
coolers. This collection represented a sample across
one tidal period (referred to as the discrete
sample). Discrete samples were sorted and preserved
(95% ethanol) later the same day or were
frozen and sorted at a later date in the laboratory.
Pit traps not flooded upon collection of the discrete
sample were not used in calculating average catch
per unit effort, but were included in estimates of
flooding frequency at each invasion stage.
We measured individual fish from samples to the
nearest 0.5 mm total length, using calipers. All
species were identified using published descriptions
(Hardy 1978; Able and Fahay 1998). We counted
dorsal fin rays of Fundulus spp. that measured
,20 mm total length (TL) to distinguish between
F. heteroclitus and F. luciae. We determined an
approximate life stage for each fish according to
body length (mm TL; F. heteroclitus: larvae 5.5ñ9,
juvenile 10ñ39, adult .40; F. luciae: larvae 5ñ10,
juvenile 11ñ17, and adult .18; Able and Fahay
1998; Able et al. unpublished data).Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for
differences in total aboveground biomass, stem
density (live and dead stems), stem height (live
stems), litter biomass, standing water, and temperature
(recorded from pit traps) among invasion
stages at each study location. Data were log
transformed to meet the assumptions of normality.
A posteriori means testing was determined by
Tukeyís studentized range test for equal sample
Marsh Fish Response to Phragmites Invasion 489
sizes (Zar 1999). Because the assumptions of
ANOVA were not met for salinity (recorded from
pit traps), flood depth (5 and 13 m from the marsh
edge), and the abundance of fish collected in pit
traps by invasion stage, we used Kruskal-Wallis to
examine differences among invasion stages for
these data. Multiple comparison tests for an unbalanced
design with ranking ties (Zar 1999) were
used to assess differences among invasion stages.
Separate Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed for the
effect of invasion stage on mean catch per unit
effort of F. heteroclitus and F. luciae (number per
replicate invasion stage) for each study location and
sample (i.e., cumulative or discrete), where sample
size was sufficient. Statistical significance for all
analyses was assigned at p , 0.05.
xresults
A total of 14 species of vegetation were identified
from 144 quadrants. For comparison, we grouped
vegetation by dominant species (i.e., Phragmites and
Spartina spp.) and a combined species group that
included all other plant species. Mean percent
biomass of each vegetation group differed by
invasion stage for each study location (Fig. 1).
There was a change in plant species composition
along the sequence of invasion stages, such that late
invasion stages were effectively Phragmites monocultures.
Mean aboveground biomass varied by study
location and invasion stage (Table 1). Although
aboveground biomass increased sequentially from
natural marsh to late invasion stages for each
estuary, differences among invasion stages were
significant in New Jersey and Delaware, but not in
Maryland (ANOVA; New Jersey: F3,44 5 9.5, n 5 48,
p # 0.0001; Delaware: F3,44 5 6.4, n 5 48, p #
0.001; Maryland: F3,44 5 2.5, n 5 48, p 5 0.069). A
posteriori means testing demonstrated that New
Jersey early and late invasion stages, and Delaware
late invasion stages had significantly higher aboveground
biomass than natural marsh and initial
invasion stages. The effect of invasion stage on stem
density was significant for each estuary (ANOVA;
New Jersey: F3,44 5 19.6, n 5 48, p , 0.0001;
Delaware: F3,44 5 43.7, n 5 48, p , 0.0001;
Maryland: F3,44 5 14.9, n 5 48, p , 0.0001;
Table 1). Mean stem height varied significantly
among invasion stages in each estuary (ANOVA;
New Jersey: F3,44 5 40.8, n 5 48, p , 0.0001;
Delaware: F3,44 5 73.6, n 5 48, p , 0.0001;
Maryland: F3,44 5 53.8, n 5 48, p , 0.0001). We
found significant differences between mean stem
height of early and late invasion stages and natural
marsh and initial invasion stages, as well as between
early and late invasion stages in each study estuary.
Litter biomass varied across invasion stages at each
study location. Mean litter biomass increased
significantly between natural marsh, and both early
and late invasion stages for all study locations
(ANOVA; New Jersey: F3,44 5 20.1, n 5 48, p ,
0.0001; Delaware: F3,44 5 4.3, n 5 48, p 5 0.01;
Maryland: F3,44 5 29.6, n 5 48, p , 0.0001). Litter
biomass from natural marsh and initial invasion stages did not differ significantly for any study
location.
Water temperature (ANOVA; New Jersey: F3,45 5
0.2, p 5 0.89; Delaware: F3,52 5 1.0, p 5 0.38;
Maryland: F3,49 5 0.5, p 5 0.68) and salinity
(Kruskal Wallis; New Jersey: x2 5 1.5, df 5 3, p 5
0.67; Delaware: x2 5 1.0, df 5 3, p 5 0.78; Maryland:
x2 5 7.1, df 5 3, p 5 0.069) recorded from pit traps
were not significantly different among invasion
stages at any study location (Table 1). Marsh surface
flooding frequency and depth, as measured with
flood gauges installed at 5 and 13 m distances from
the marsh edge, varied by invasion stage at each
study location (Fig. 2). Relative flooding frequency
for each invasion stage was determined as the
proportion of occasions over the study period when
at least one pit trap was flooded during collection of
discrete samples. Frequency of marsh surface flooding
over the daytime high tide decreased across the
sequence of invasion stages for each location. Flood
depth at 5 m from the marsh edge showed
a significant decrease from natural marsh through
late invasion stages in New Jersey and Maryland
(Kruskal-Wallis; New Jersey: x2 5 11.3, df 5 3, p 5
0.01; Maryland: x2 5 17.1, df 5 3, p 5 0.0007). New
Jersey early invasion stage flooded with greater
average depth than initial invasion stages at that
location. Differences in flood depth at 5 m were not
significant in Delaware (Kruskal-Wallis; x2 5 4.7, df
5 3, p 5 0.19), but there was a trend for flood
depth to decrease through the progression of the
invasion stages. Although there were significant
differences in flood depth at 13 m between natural
marsh and late invasion stages in New Jersey
(Kruskal-Wallis; x2 5 9.3, df 5 3, p 5 0.025), there
were no differences in Delaware (Kruskal-Wallis;
x2 5 5.5, df 5 3, p 5 0.13) or Maryland (KruskalWallis:
x2 5 3.7, df 5 3, p 5 0.28). Within invasion
stages, maximum flood depth at 13 m was generally
lower than at the 5 m distance from the marsh
edge.
Marsh surface standing water at low tide varied
across the sequence of invasion stages at each study
location (Table 1). Abundance of marsh surface
standing water at early and late invasion stages was
lower than natural marsh and initial invasion stages
at all study locations (mean percent standing water
6 standard error [SE]: natural marsh 5.7 6 0.8,
initial 6.0 6 0.5, early 3.9 6 1.3, late 2.4 6 0.8).
Significant differences in marsh surface standing
water were found in Delaware (ANOVA; F3,7 5 12.1,
p 5 0.02) and Maryland (ANOVA; F3,7 5 8.9, p 5
0.03), but not in New Jersey (ANOVA; F3,7 5 2.1,
p 5 0.24). A posteriori means testing showed that
initial invasion stages in Delaware and Maryland
were significantly different from late invasion
stages, whereas early invasion stages were only n 5 3) and Anguilla rostrata (American eel, n 5 3)
were infrequently collected.
The abundance of F. heteroclitus collected by pit
traps varied significantly by invasion stage in
cumulative (Kruskal-Wallis; New Jersey: x2 5 36.2,
df 5 3, p , 0.0001; Delaware: x2 5 26.8, df 5 3, p ,
0.0001; Maryland: x2 5 15.3, df 5 3, p 5 0.002) and
discrete samples (Kruskal-Wallis; New Jersey: x2 5
18.9, df 5 3, p 5 0.0003; Maryland: x2 5 10.1, df 5
3, p 5 0.017). Abundance of this species in discrete
samples from Delaware was not different among
invasion stages (Kruskal-Wallis; x2 5 5.9, df 5 3, p 5
0.114). For the majority of comparisons among
invasion stages, a posteriori means testing showed
that natural marsh and initial invasion stages had
significantly higher abundances relative to early and
late invasion stages in cumulative samples (Fig. 3).
For discrete samples, there was a significantly higher
abundance of F. heteroclitus in natural marsh versus
both early and late invasion stages in New Jersey,
and between natural marsh and late invasion stages
in Maryland. The combined catch (%) of F.
heteroclitus, across all sites, in cumulative and
discrete samples declined from natural marsh
(51.6) through initial (33.8), early (12.3), and late
invasion stages (2.4).
Collections of F. luciae in cumulative and discrete
samples at each study location varied by invasion
stage (Fig. 4). In discrete samples, there were no F.
luciae collected from early invasion stages in New
Jersey or from late invasion stages at any location.
Sample sizes of F. luciae from all Delaware collections,
as well as discrete collections from Maryland,
were too low to detect statistical differences among
invasion stages. Abundance of F. luciae varied
significantly with invasion stage in New Jersey for
cumulative (Kruskal-Wallis; x2 5 21.7, df 5 3, p ,
0.0001) and discrete samples (Kruskal-Wallis; x2 5
18.8, df 5 3, p 5 0.0002), but not in Maryland
(cumulative: x2 5 6.3, df 5 3, p 5 0.099). A
posteriori testing determined that abundance of F.
luciae in New Jersey natural marsh stages was
significantly higher than early and late invasion
stages in cumulative and discrete samples. Cumulative
abundance of this species in initial invasion
stages was significantly higher than late invasion
stages at this location. The combined catch (%) of
F. luciae, across all sites, in cumulative and discrete
samples declined from natural marsh (48.9)
through initial (39.1), early (9.3), and late invasion
stages (2.7).
The majority of Fundulus spp. in cumulative and
discrete collections were smaller young-of-the-year
fishes (,40 mm TL). Because of the rarity of fish in
early and late invasions stages (Figs. 3 and 4), we did
not test for differences in fish size among invasion
stages. There was a trend in the three study estuaries A total of four fish species (n 5 3,787 individuals)
were captured in pit traps in all locations over the
study period. The most abundant species collected
was F. heteroclitus, which represented 93.9% of the
combined catch (cumulative n 5 2,708; discrete
n 5 848). F. luciae was collected less frequently and
represented 5.9% of the total catch (cumulative n 5
151; discrete n 5 74). Gobiosoma bosc (naked goby.for F. heteroclitus length (mm TL) to decrease from
natural marsh through late invasion stages (natural
marsh 11.3 6 1.4, initial 11.2 6 1.2, early 10.1 6 1.1,
late 9.4 6 1.1; Fig. 5). Mean length of F. luciae also
was higher in natural marsh stages when compared
to initial, early, and late invasion stages (natural
marsh 18.7 6 1.7, initial 13.0 6 2.6, early 10.8 6 3.8,
late 13.3 6 2.2). Mean fish length of F. luciae was
higher than F. heteroclitus at the various invasion
stages because the relative ratio of F. luciae larvae to
juvenile and adult stages (0.58:1) was less than that
of F. heteroclitus (2.2:1)
xdiscussion
Evaluating effects of marsh response to perturbation
and restoration relies, critically, on study site
selection, especially for reference marshes (Zedler
2000). This is the first study to examine the
Phragmites invasion on two levels of spatial scale, in
that we have examined the invasion over multiple
estuaries, as well as at distinct invasion stages within
individual estuaries. We confirmed that stages of the
Phragmites invasion occurred in three estuaries along
the mid Atlantic coast and that these invasion stages
are likely detectable across the range of watersheds
where Phragmites is invasive.Structural changes to the canopy and marsh
surface resulting from Phragmites invasion are well
documented and correspond with findings in this
study. Descriptions of natural marsh and initial
invasion stages were typical of Spartina spp. and lowdensity
Phragmites habitats, whereas early and late
invasion stages were more similar to Phragmites
dominated habitats from previous studies (Meyerson
et al. 2000; Angradi et al. 2001; Able et al. 2003;
Osgood et al. 2003; Raichel et al. 2003). Since some
modifications of marsh structure are associated with
the increasing establishment of Phragmites stands,greater alterations were expected in our study in
later invasion stages (Able et al. 2003). The changes
in vegetation (species composition, aboveground
biomass, stem density, stem height) among invasion
stages were more pronounced in both early and late
invasion stages for most comparisons (Fig. 1). With
the exception of Maryland, aboveground biomass
increased significantly through invasion stages with
early and late invasion stages providing 2ñ3 times
more live vegetation than natural marsh and initial
invasion stages (Table 1). Further evidence for
structural alteration among invasion stages was
provided by significantly higher stem density in
natural marsh and initial invasion stages. There was
an 84% difference between the highest (i.e., natural
marsh or initial invasion) and lowest (i.e., early or
late invasion) stem density among invasion stages
(Table 1). Among study locations, aboveground
biomass and stem height in Delaware late invasion
stages were 2ñ3 times greater than late invasion
stages in New Jersey and Maryland. Low salinity has
been shown to increase Phragmites aboveground
productivity in some studies (Chambers et al. 2003;
Burdick and Konisky 2003), but not in others
(Meyerson et al. 2000). It is possible that relatively
higher salinities in New Jersey and Maryland could
have reduced Phragmites growth in these locations
(Table 1).
In addition to changes in vegetation structure,
Phragmites modifies the physical environment
(Windham and Lathrop 1999; Able et al. 2003;
Rooth et al. 2003). Dense Phragmites stands have
been previously shown to reduce marsh surface
temperature (Angradi et al. 2001), seemingly
because of the reduced amount of solar radiation
that reaches the marsh surface relative to native
marshes (Meyerson et al. 2000). Our results did not
show significant trends among invasion stages in
water temperature or salinity recorded in pit traps.
Similar nonsignificant results for salinity were found
between Phragmites and noninvaded sites in a Connecticut
marsh (Talley and Levin 2001). The lack of
significant differences in our study suggests that
temperature and salinity may not have contributed
to the invasion stage-specific response of marsh
surface fishes.
Decreased flooding frequency, depth, and drainage
area are commonplace in Phragmites dominated
habitats (Able et al. 2003; Osgood et al. 2003). In
our study, early and late invasion stages showed
large alterations in flood dynamics (Fig. 2). In
contrast to natural marsh stages, initial, early, and
late invasion stages showed reductions in marsh
surface flooding of 7%, 16%, and 37%, respectively.
Reduction in flood frequency was further emphasized
through the progression of invasion stages, as
we found that flood depth at 5 m from the marsh
edge was significantly less in late invasion stages at
two of the three study estuaries. Although we did
not directly measure elevation, and are lacking
elevation data prior to invasion by Phragmites at our
study sites, decreased flood frequency and depth
through the transition of natural marsh to late
invasion stages suggests there is an increase in
marsh elevation as the invasion progresses, particularly
at 5 m from the marsh edge.
Prior research has suggested that drier conditions
and thick litter mats are characteristic of Phragmites
stands and that the addition of litter to the high
marsh contributes to marsh flattening (Rooth et al.
2003). Corresponding with previous literature (Able
and Hagan 2000, 2003), we documented significant
increases in litter biomass through Phragmites invasion
stages. We calculated an average increase in
litter biomass from natural marsh and initial
invasion stages of 159% and 340% in early and late
invasion stages, respectively. In previous evaluations
of marsh surface fish habitat, there was significantly
lower standing water and marsh depressions in
Phragmites stands, than in areas dominated by
Spartina spp. (Able and Hagan 2000, 2003; Able et
al. 2003; Raichel et al. 2003). Marsh surface shallow
water habitats such as ditches (remnants of mosquito
control) and pools have been described in
Phragmites marshes in some locations (see Raposa
and Roman 2001; Osgood et al. 2003), but these
features were not present in our study areas. During
our assessments, patterns of standing water abundance
decreased through the sequence of invasion
stages for each study location (Table 1). The
consistently low abundance of shallow water habitat
on the marsh surface in late invasion stages suggests
that standing water is most affected at this stage.Patterns of fish distribution and abundance
among invasion stages in this study provide evidence
that young-of-the-year marsh resident fishes
are responding negatively to the Phragmites invasion
in brackish marsh habitats across a broad geographic
region. Fundulus spp. were most abundant
in our collections. This is consistent with reports for
other brackish marsh systems (Yozzo and Smith
1998; Able et al. 2003; Yozzo and Ottman 2003).
Because we collected from pit traps on varying
temporal scales, i.e., cumulative and discrete samples,
the relative contributions of the marsh surface
fauna were somewhat different. Relative to invasion
stage, fish species composition did not differ for
cumulative samples. We did not collect either
Fundulus spp. in late invasion stages in discrete
samples in New Jersey. F. luciae was absent from
discrete samples in late invasion stages from
Delaware and Maryland. Discrete samples collected
Marsh Fish Response to Phragmites Invasion 495
fewer individuals of both Fundulus spp. than
cumulative samples. Significant differences in catch
per unit effort among invasion stages were more
common for cumulative samples (Figs. 3 and 4). We
attribute this difference, and other differences
between these samples, to the larger exposure time
of pit traps collected as cumulative samples. Larval
and juvenile F. heteroclitus are mobile (Able et al. In
press), but movements may not have been sufficient
to encounter pit traps over a single tidal period.
Results from cumulative samples may better represent
the abundance of larval and juvenile fishes
using marsh surface habitats, but discrete samples
may be more reflective of short-term tidal responses.
In previous studies across several locations in New
Jersey, abundance of F. heteroclitus recovered from
pit traps in natural Spartina spp. and Phragmites
dominated marshes over one tidal period (i.e.,
discrete samples) has repeatedly shown significant
declines between natural marsh and advanced
invasion stage marsh types (Able and Hagan 2000,
2003; Able et al. 2003). F. heteroclitus also showed
a marked response to the different invasion stages
in our study. There was no significant difference
among invasion stages for this species in discrete
samples in Delaware, but the pattern of abundance
indicated a decline across invasion stages (Fig. 3).
Together, all these studies suggest that as the
Phragmites invasion progresses, alterations in habitat
function for larval and smaller juvenile F. heteroclitus
take place. This change in habitat function is
especially important when one considers the role
that F. heteroclitus plays in structuring marsh ecosystems
(Kneib 1997). Results from a new study suggest
that the lower habitat quality provided by Phragmites
marshes may contribute to significantly decreased
productivity of F. heteroclitus (Hagan et al. unpublished
data).
While F. heteroclitus declined across all invasion
stages, the response of F. luciae was more distinct
because there was an increased rarity of F. luciae
through the sequence of invasion stages suggesting
that all life stages of this species are affected by the
Phragmites invasion. Although there were no significant
differences in the cumulative abundance
among invasion stages in Delaware and Maryland,
lower sample sizes of F. luciae precluded rigorous
analysis. The effects of early and late invasion stages
on F. luciae were significant in New Jersey, where this
species was collected most frequently. Based on
prevalence of early and late invasion stages and the
timing and degree of landscape coverage by
Phragmites (.80%) at our New Jersey study location
(Windham and Lathrop 1999), results from this
location may demonstrate the long-term effect of
extensive habitat alterations by Phragmites on F.
luciae. Any further decline may threaten the
maintenance of local populations, because this
species is not abundant (Able et al. 1983; Yozzo
and Ottman 2003) and does not disperse readily
(Able et al. In press).
Changes in marsh surface landscape structure
across invasion stages may account for differences
in observed fish abundance and size compositions.
Larval Fundulus are advanced relative to other
marsh fish larvae (Sakowicz 2003), but are still
relatively poor swimmers and may be unable to
maintain position even at low water velocities. When
considering the role of plant stem density in the
aquatic (i.e., flooded) habitat beyond its function as
a predation refuge (Minello and Zimmerman
1992), differences in plant growth form and
resulting canopy structures may provide shelter
from tidal current velocity, particularly to larval fish
inhabiting the marsh surface. Evidence for the
refuge value of dense marsh vegetation was provided
by a field transplant experiment that examined
the ecosystem function of three phenotypically
distinct forms of Spartina alterniflora (Seliskar et al.
2002). In their study, density of larval F. heteroclitus
was twice as great in areas planted with the S.
alterniflora variety of highest stem density, confirming
its higher refuge value. The only comparison of
tidal flow between Spartina spp. and Phragmites
marshes did not provide significant evidence that
flow velocities differ between the vegetation types,
although very low water levels encountered at the
particular study sites may have limited plant-flow
interactions (Leonard et al. 2002). We suspect that
the lower abundance and narrower size range of
F. heteroclitus and F. luciae in early and late invasion
stages may have resulted from the inability of locally
hatched individuals to be retained and grow in
these stages because of lower abundance of standing
water and perhaps refugia from currents. Responses
to current regime in Phragmites marshes also may
explain why larger F. heteroclitus are able to use both
marsh types effectively (Able and Hagan 2000;
Currin et al. 2003). Our speculation calls for more
studies of the behavior of larval marsh surface fishes
relative to habitat type.We have studied multiple invasion stages and
estuaries to gain insight into the long-term consequences
of the Phragmites invasion across local and
regional scales. Our study strongly suggests that the
late invasion stage is a drastically altered habitat for
larval and juvenile marsh surface fishes, and that
Fundulus spp. respond negatively to this stage of the
Phragmites invasion, although there is evidence of
reduced population size at earlier stages as well.
Maintaining marshes invaded by Phragmites in
earlier stages (initial invasion stage) may allow these
496 K. L. Hunter et al.
marshes to function as habitats for resident marsh
fishes in a manner similar to that of natural
marshes, as we have found in this study. This
potential management approach has limitations
due to difficulties in halting the progression of
Phragmites to late invasion stages where it becomes
established. One exception may be in higher salinity
marshes in which Phragmites advances less vigorously.
Using available management methods, maintenance
of Phragmites in initial invasion stages might
be an appropriate suggestion for higher salinity
marshes but is less likely to be as effective in low
salinity marshes.
The results from this study corroborate previous
evidence of the negative response of early life
history stages of marsh surface fishes to habitat
modifications associated with Phragmites invasion of
Spartina marshes (Able and Hagan 2000, 2003; Able
et al. 2003; Raichel et al. 2003) and other marsh
types (Raposa and Roman 2001; Warren et al. 2001;
Hanson et al. 2002; Osgood et al. 2003 In press).
Studies that have shown no Phragmites effect may
have occurred because of variation between systems,
fish life stages, and nonstandardization across
invasion stages. We suggest that considerable
attention should be paid to the stage of invasion
when studying the effect of Phragmites on resident
fish fauna and marsh landscapes.
