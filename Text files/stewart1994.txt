xabstract Changes in benthic macroinvertebrate communities inhabiting natural
cobble and artificial reef substrates in southwestern Lake Ontario were quantified
following invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and "quagga" mussels
(Dreissena sp.). Post-Dreissena invasion data (1991-1992) were compared with preinvasion
data (1983) from the same sites. In 1991-1992, Dreissena comprised 79% and
93% of macroinvertebrates collected at cobble and artificial reef sites, respectively,
replacing the amphipod Gammarus fasciatus as the numerically dominant taxon at
both sites. Total abundance of non-Dreissena macroinvertebrates was significantly
greater at both sites in 1991ó1992 than in 1983. Taxa showing the greatest increases
in abundance at the cobble site included the annelids Manayunkia speciosa, Spirosperma
ferox, and unidentified tubificids; the gastropods Helisoma anceps, Physa heterostropha,
Stagnicola catascopium, Valvata tricarinata, Goniobasis livescens, and
Amnicola limosa; the amphipod Gammarus fasciatus; and the decapod Orconectes
propinquis. At the artificial reef site, significant population increases of Physa heterostropha,
Valvata tricarinata, Goniobasis livescens, Amnicola limosa, Gammarus fasciatus
and the trichopteran Polycentropus were observed. No taxon was less abundant in
1991ó1992 than 1983. Comparisons of macroinvertebrate community similarity in
1983 and 1991-1992 by Morisita's Index, excluding Dreissena, indicated that previously
established taxa did not change substantially between 1983 and 1991-1992 at
either site. Although many factors may have contributed to the changes observed, our
results support theories that Dreissena is facilitating energy transfer to the benthos
through pseudofecal / fecal deposition, and that mussel colonies are providing additional
habitat for other invertebrate taxa. 


xintroduction


 The first sighting of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in the Great Lakes occurred
within Lake St. Clair in June 1988 (Hebert et al. 1989). Since then, the "quagga"
mussel, believed to be a second species of Dreissena, has also invaded the Great
Lakes (May and Marsden 1992). At present, Dreissena is colonizing portions of all the
Great Lakes, with exception of Lake Superior. Spread of Dreissena through the Great
Lakes has generated concern among ecologists for several reasons. Of particular importance
is the ability of adult Dreissena populations to 1) completely cover and
change the physical structure of hard substrates (Lewandowski 1976, Stanczykowska
1977); and 2) reduce limnetic phytoplankton biomass by filter feeding (Reeders and
Bij de Vaate 1990, MacIsaac et al. 1992, Leach 1993), likely impacting species dependent
upon this food resource (Mackie 1991, Schloesser and Kovalak 1991). Concern
about the impact of Dreissena upon other taxa (Hebert et al. 1991, Mackie 1991) has
prompted studies of effects on a diverse array of faunal and floral taxa (MacIsaac et al.
1991, Wu and Culver 1991, Wormington and Leach 1992, Leach 1993).
Since Dreissena and other benthic macroinvertebrate taxa are fairly sessile, often occupy
the same substrates (Sebestyen 1938), and in some instances may consume similar
foods (Hebert et al. 1991, Mackie 1991), changes in previously established benthic
macroinvertebrate communities following Dreissena invasion are possible (Mackie et
al. 1989, Reeders and Bij de Vaate 1990, Hebert et al. 1991). Investigations of Dreissena
impacts on some Great Lakes benthic macroinvertebrate taxa have been conducted
(Mackie 1991, Hunter and Bailey 1992, Dermott et al. 1993, Griffiths 1993). However,
scarcity of pre-invasion data has made assessment of Dreissena impacts on many
pre-established macroinvertebrate taxa difficult. Quantitative analysis of macroinvertebrate
communities occupying natural cobble and artificial reef sites in southwestern
Lake Ontario by Bader (1985), followed by invasion of these sites by Dreissena in
1990 (Haynes, personal observation), provided an opportunity to investigate benthic
macroinvertebrate community changes resulting from Dreissena colonization. 
xmethods The study sites were situated 1.1-1.6 km west and 0.5-0.8 km offshore of Olcott, New
York, in the southwestern region of Lake Ontario (Fig. 1). Physical characteristics of
the cobble site (latitude = 43∞20'9" N; longitude = 78∞44'48"W) were representative of
the benthic environment naturally found along this nearshore region of Lake Ontario.
The gradually sloping lake bed was covered with gravel and small rocks, though some
scattered boulders as large as 0.25 m in diameter were present. The artificial reef site
(latitude = 43∞20'9" N; longitude = 78∞45'30" W; Fig. 1) was located 0.5 km west of
the cobble site. The artificial reef was constructed in 1981-1982 of siltstone and shale.
Particle sizes on the reef ranged from small pebbles to boulders approximately 0.5 m
in diameter. Although six discrete piles of material were placed in the area, all samples
were collected from two reef sections located along the 7 m contour (Fig. 1). These
sections, approximately 30 meters in length, are connected to each other by cinderblocks. 

This study was designed to replicate that of Bader (1985), who quantified abundances
of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa at cobble and artificial reef sites in 1983, 7 years
before establishment of Dreissena populations. The present study duplicated sampling
methods employed in the 1983 study and included additional sampling methods for
Dreissena, which required different sampling methodology. Samples were randomly
collected by SCUBA divers at five stations along 30 m transects at cobble and artifi-
cial reef sites on 12 July and 21 September 1991, and 15 May and 20-23 August 1992.
Sampling depths ranged from 5-7 m below the water surface (Fig. 1). Macroinvertebrate taxa (with exception of Dreissena) were collected by sampling for
a 3-minute period at each sampling location (Bader 1985) with a dome suction
sampler (Gale and Thompson 1975), which enclosed an area of 0.165 m2
 and was
equipped with a 0.5 mm mesh collecting bag. The dome suction sampler was made of
a serrated steel band, effective in penetrating cobble site substrate and providing a seal
between sampler and substrate. Although the serrated band prevented establishment of
a tight seal between the band and hard artificial reef substrate, perhaps allowing some
organisms to escape, this design was used to maintain consistency between 1983
(Bader 1985) and 1991-1992 sampling methods.
Because the dome suction sampler lacked power needed to remove enough Dreissena
from substrates to obtain accurate representations of population sizes, plot sampling
(Stanczyckowska 1977, Lewandowski and Stanczyckowska 1986, Hebert et al. 1991)
was used to obtain abundance estimates of Dreissena. A square frame enclosing an
area of 0.185 m2
 was placed on cobble and artificial reef substrates, adjacent to the
dome sampler, at three of the five sampling stations. Rocks forming the surface of the
enclosed area were manually placed in a 0.5 mm mesh collecting bag. On the dive
boat, Dreissena were removed from rocks by scraping with a hard-bristle brush (Piesik
1983). Samples were initially preserved in 3-5% buffered formalin with rose bengal dye (200
mg/L). Within 24 hours, this solution was replaced with 70% ethanol (Clesceri et al.
1989). In the laboratory, macroinvertebrates were separated from other debris under a
stereoscopic microscope (5x power). Subsampling (Elliott 1971) was used to obtain
abundance estimates of Dreissena. Dreissena were uniformly mixed in a dissecting
pan, and 500 undamaged individuals were removed (beginning at the upper left region
of the pan and proceeding from left to right). This procedure improved the likelihood
of unbiased selection of individuals for enumeration (Elliott 1971). The average
mass/individual was calculated after the 500 mussels were blotted dry and weighed.
Abundance estimates (# individuals/m2
) from each replicate sample were determined
based on the average mass/individual and the total mass of zebra mussels in the
sample. Based on weights of three sets of 500 mussels selected from the same sample
in a preliminary trial, an index of precision (Elliott 1971) demonstrated that use of
weights was suitable in estimating Dreissena abundance if a standard error equivalent
to 5% of the mean is tolerated.
Abundance estimates of other taxa were usually obtained by direct counts of individuals
after identifications were made under stereoscopic (Nematoda, Turbellaria, Hirudinea,
Mollusca, and Arthropoda with exception of Chironomidae) or compound (other
Annelida, Chironomidae) microscopes. A damaged turbellarian, annelid, or arthropod
was included in counts if the animal's head was present. Damaged mollusks were
included in counts if the animals were attached to their shells. On four occasions (one
cobble site sample on 12 July 1991 and three cobble site samples on 20 August 1992),
sub-sampling of oligochaetes was employed due to their high abundances. Oligochaete
subsampling involved counting all oligochaetes present in the sample, thoroughly mixing
the animals, then proceeding to identify to the lowest taxonomic level every
second individual encountered as we proceeded from left to right through this assemblage
(Elliott 1971). Subsequent to identification of individuals, the total count for
each taxon would be doubled to provide abundance estimates of each taxon in the
sample. Abundances of Hydracharina and Unionidae, quantified in 1991-1992 but not
in 1983, are not included here. Bader's (1985) neglect of these taxa is understandable
since the size ranges of these organisms make accurate abundance estimates by dome
sampling difficult. Abundance estimates of additional taxa are reported in Stewart
(1993), along with detailed descriptions of field and laboratory methods.
Mean macroinvertebrate abundance estimates, standard errors, and ranges (95% confidence
limits) were calculated for artificial reef and cobble site taxa on each sampling
date. Differences in abundance estimates between 12 July 1983 and 12 July 1991; 10
September 1983 and 21 September 1991; 11 May 1983 and 15 May 1992; and 31 August
1983 and 20-23 August 1992 were determined by two-sample t-test after log +1
transformation of abundance estimates (Elliott 1971).
Changes in composition of macroinvertebrate communities between 1983 and 1991-92
were further analyzed by Morisita's Community Similarity Index (Brower and Zar
1977). This index is based on the probability that two individuals, randomly selected
from two different communities, will belong to the same taxon. Mean abundance estimates
for each taxon on each sampling date were used to calculate the degree of similarity
between cobble site communities (1983 and 1991-1992), artificial reef communities
(1983 and 1991-1992), cobble site and artificial reef communities (1983), and
cobble site and artificial reef communities (1991 ó 1992). Morisita's Index was calculated
including and excluding 1991-1992 abundance estimates of Dreissena. Species
diversity was measured by counting the number of taxa collected at each site on each
sampling date. Mann-Whitney U-tests (Elliott 1971) were used to assess changes in
community composition and number of taxa collected in 1991-1992 relative to 1983. 
xresults Relative abundance estimates of taxa whose abundance estimates comprised at least
1% of all benthic macroinvertebrates collected at cobble and artificial reef sites are
shown in Table 1. Dreissena dominated cobble (79%) and artificial reef (93%) macroinvertebrate
communities in 1991-1992. Approximately 99% of Dreissena collected in
1991-1992 were zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, while the remaining 1% were
"quagga" mussels, Dreissena sp. (L. Ben Motten, State University of New York College
at Brockport, unpublished data). In contrast, the amphipod Gammarus fasciatus
was numerically dominant on both cobble (55%) and artificial reef (78%) sites in
1983. If Dreissena is disregarded (Table 1), it is evident that evenness of other numerically
important taxa remained high and may have even increased since 1983, especially
at the cobble site. While taxa of numerical importance in 1983 remained so in
1991-1992, some taxa of little numerical importance in 1983, such as the oligochaetes 
Stylaria lacustris, Potamothrix vejdovskyi, and Spirosperma ferox, and the gastropod
Amnicola limosa, were of increased importance in 1991-1992. 


Abundance estimates of taxa collected at cobble and artificial reef sites in 1983 and
1991-1992 are provided in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Estimated abundance (mean ±
SE) of Dreissena at the cobble site in 1991-1992 ranged from a low of 5,919 ± 489/m2
in July to a high of 20,773 ± 315/m2
 in August (Table 2). Estimated abundance of
Dreissena at the artificial reef site ranged from a low of 19,486 ± 5,056/m2
 in May to a
high of 55,508 ± 11,627/m2 in July (Table 3). Total abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates
at the cobble site was significantly greater (p < 0.01) on all 1991-1992
sampling dates (range = 8,309 ± 997 to 25,743 ± 1,240/m2
), relative to sampling dates
from the same months in 1983 (range = 261 ± 91 to 1,159 ± 107/m2
; Table 2). If
Dreissena was not included in 1991-1992 cobble counts, abundance increases since
1983 (range = 1,316 ± 170 to 4,595 ± 745/m2
) were still observed during three of the
four months (p < 0.05). Taxa more abundant (p < 0.05) at the cobble site in 1991-1992 on a minimum of two
dates relative to the same dates in 1983 were the polychaete Manayunkia speciosa, the
tubificid Spirosperma ferox, unidentified (primarily immature) tubificids, and
Dreissena; the gastropods Helisoma anceps, Physa heterostropha, Stagnicola
catascopium, Valvata tricarinata, Goniobasis livescens, and Amnicola limosa; the
amphipod Gammarus fasciatus and the decapod Orconectes propinquis (Table 2).
Total abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates at the artificial reef site was greater (p
< 0.01) in 1991-1992 (range = 20,859 ± 5,363 to 58,018 ± 11,954/m2
) than 1983
(range = 127 ± 41 to 1,866 ± 577/m2
) on all four dates (Table 3). Excluding Dreissena
from comparisons, abundance increases (p < 0.05) also were observed on all 1991-
1992 dates (range = 1,373 ± 307 to 5,267 + 523/m2
) relative to 1983. 
Taxa more abundant (p < 0.05) in 1991-1992 than 1983 on two or more dates were
Dreissena, Physa heterostropha, Valvata tricarinata, Goniobasis livescens, Amnicola
limosa, Gammarus fasciatus, and the trichopteran Polycentropus (Table 3).
Eight taxa collected at the cobble site in 1983 were not collected in 1991-1992, while
17 taxa collected at the cobble site in 1991-1992 were not collected on similar dates in
1983 (Table 2). Four taxa collected at the artificial reef site in 1983 were not collected
in 1991-1992, and 20 taxa collected at the artificial reef site in 1991-1992 were not
collected on similar dates in 1983 (Table 3). No taxon exhibited a significant population
decline between 1983 and 1991-1992 on more than one sampling date at either
site (Tables 2 and 3). Changes in benthic macroinvertebrate community composition at the cobble and artificial
reef sites, according to Morisita's Index (MI), are presented in Table 4. When Dreissena
was included in calculations of the index, little community similarity was
observed between 1991-1992 and 1983 for the cobble site (MI range = 0.03-0.13) or
the artificial reef site (MI range = 0.03-0.11). Excluding Dreissena from the calculations
revealed significantly greater similarity (p < 0.05) between 1991-1992 and
1983 for the cobble (MI range = 0.50-0.88) and the artificial reef (MI range = 0.70-
0.99) communities. Community similarity at the artificial reef site between 1991-1992
and 1983 was especially high on three of the four sampling dates (Table 4). Similarities
in Morisita's Index values obtained when Dreissena was not included in community
comparisons support the observations (Table 1) that numerically important taxa at
both sites in 1983 remained numerically important in 1991-1992.
Same year comparisons between cobble and artificial reef site communities (Table 4),
including Dreissena, suggested that both communities were similar to each other in
1991-1992 (MI range = 0.95-0.99) and in 1983 (MI range = 0.86-0.97). Excluding
Dreissena from calculations of Morisita's Index, the cobble and artificial reef
communities were less similar (p < 0.05) to each other in 1991-1992 (MI range =
0.38-0.84) than in 1983. Post-Dreissena population increases of oligochaetes at the
cobble site, relative to the artificial reef site (Tables 2 and 3), contributed to compositional
divergence of the two communities in 1991-1992 relative to 1983 (Table 4). Although oligochaete populations also increased at the artificial reef site between 1983
and 1991-1992, changes were less dramatic than at the cobble site where substrate more
favorable to burrowing taxa was more prevalent. The overwhelming dominance of
Dreissena at both sites in 1991-1992 (Table 1) made it otherwise appear that the two
sites had nearly identical community compositions (Table 4). The number of taxa collected at cobble and artificial reef sites was greater (p < 0.05)
in 1991-1992 than in 1983 (Table 5). The number of taxa collected at the cobble site in
1991 - 1992 ranged from 27 to 32 taxa per sampling date, while no more than 22 taxa
were collected in 1983. Numbers of taxa at the artificial reef site ranged from 19 to 26
taxa in 1991-1992. In contrast, no more than 15 taxa were collected on a sampling date
in 1983. xdiscussion 
Our data suggest that Dreissena has thus far had a positive impact on benthic macroinvertebrate
communities at cobble and artificial reef sites in southwestern Lake Ontario.
Population changes of some taxa are similar to those reported by other researchers
who have studied impacts of Dreissena on benthic macroinvertebrate communities
in Lakes Erie and St. Clair.
Dermott et al. (1993) found total macroinvertebrate abundance (excluding Dreissena)
on northeastern Lake Erie bedrock substrates to be greater on bedrock heavily colonized
by Dreissena polymorpha than on uncolonized bedrock. Among specific taxa,
gastropods and Gammarus fasciatus were significantly more abundant on colonized
than on uncolonized substrates. Griffiths (1993) found total abundance and species
richness of benthic macroinvertebrates increased in both northwestern and southeastern
regions of Lake St. Clair (even if Dreissena was excluded from abundance estimates)
following colonization of the southeastern region of the lake by Dreissena.
Among taxa increasing in total and relative abundance were turbellarians; the tubificids
Potamothrix moldaviensis and Spirosperma ferox; the gastropods Gyraulus sp.,
Physa gyrina, Goniobasis livescens, and Amnicola sp.; Gammarus sp. and Polycentropus.
At both of our sites in 1991-1992, Physa heterostropha, Goniobasis livescens, 
Amnicola limosa, and Gammarus fasciatus were more abundant than in 1983 (Tables
2 and 3). Spirosperma ferox and Polycentropus were more abundant in 1991-1992
than in 1983 at cobble and artificial reef sites, respectively (Tables 2 and 3). Populations
of turbellarians, Potamothrix moldaviensis, and Gyraulus parvus were relatively
unchanged at either site. We may have underestimated populations of P. moldaviensis
due to difficulty encountered in identifying this taxon. Consequently, many P. moldaviensis
individuals may have been categorized by us as unidentified Tubificidae.
Many factors potentially have contributed to benthic macroinvertebrate community
changes observed in our study. Dreissena may be facilitating transfer of nutrients to
the benthos by filter-feeding and subsequently depositing feces and pseudofeces (Wiktor
1963, Stanczykowksa et al. 1976, Reeders and Bij de Vaate 1990, Leach 1993).
Wiktor (1969) and Izvekova and Lvova-Katchanova (1972) have discussed the importance
of Dreissena feces and pseudofeces in diets of detritivorous benthic macroinvertebrates.
Saturated with bacteria and digestive enzymes, pseudofeces not only have
high nutritive value, but may be easily digested and assimilated (Izvekova and LvovaKatchanova
1972). Facultative or obligatory detritivores (Harman and Berg 1971, Hynes
1974, Caspers 1980, Klemm 1985) showing population increases at cobble or
artificial reef sites were Spirosperma ferox and other tubificids, Physa heterostropha,
Valvata tricarinata, Gammarus fasciatus, and Polycentropus (Tables 2 and 3). Dusoge
(1966), Wiktor (1969), and Lewandowski (1976) found abundance and biomass of
many benthic invertebrates in Europe, including oligochaetes and chironomids, to be
greatest among clumps of Dreissena where feces and pseudofeces accumulate. Griffiths
(1993) suspected that population increases in Potamothrix moldaviensis and Spirosperma
ferox in Lake St. Clair resulted from deposition of feces and pseudofeces by
Dreissena.
Enhanced substrate complexity also may have contributed to increased abundance and
diversity of macroinvertebrates at our study sites. By creating an interstitial network
that may increase refugia available to other benthic organisms, Dermott et al. (1993)
suggested that Dreissena was responsible for increases in Gammarus sp. observed on
bedrock substrates colonized by Dreissena. Griffiths (1993) likewise attributed population
increases of hirudineans, gastropods, Gammarus sp., Polycentropus, and the
chironomid Polypedilum in Lake St. Clair to increased substrate heterogeneity provided
by Dreissena. Of these taxa, only hirudineans and Polypedilum failed to show
significant population increases at cobble or artificial reef sites in our study between
1983 and 1991-1992 (Tables 2 and 3).
Dreissena indirectly creates benthic habitat as well. Filter-feeding improves water
clarity through removal of suspended particles (Stanczykowska 1984, Hebert et al.
1991). The resulting increase in the euphotic zone, in combination with increased transfer
of nutrients to the benthos by Dreissena, may promote growth of benthic macrophytes
(Reeders and Bij de Vaate 1990) and perhaps benthic algae as well. Positive
relationships between benthic algae and populations of nematodes, naidid oligochaetes,
hirudineans, gastropods (Gyraulus sp., Helisoma sp., Physa sp., Valvata sp.,
Goniobasis sp., Amnicola sp.), Gammarus sp., ephemeropterans, and Chironomus have
been reported from the Great Lakes in the past (Cook and Johnson 1974, Barton
and Hynes 1978). Griffiths (1993) believed that increased densities of submerged vascular
plants and benthic algae following colonization of Lake St. Clair by Dreissena
contributed to the observed increase in macroinvertebrate populations. The filamentous
alga Cladophora was present at our study sites in 1983 (Bader 1985) and in 1991-
1992, and macroinvertebrates, especially Gammarus fasciatus, were associated with it.
Some macroinvertebrate taxa may benefit by consuming or parasitizing Dreissena.
The decapod Orconectes limosus was observed to consume large numbers of Dreissena
under ideal water temperature conditions in Poland (Piesik 1974). Populations of
O. propinquis were far more abundant at the cobble site in 1991-1992 than in 1983
(Table 2), although direct consumption of Dreissena by this species has not yet been
documented. Dreissena in Europe have also been preyed upon by hirudineans (Lewan-
dowski 1976) and the oligochaete Chaetogaster sp. (Piesik 1983). It is interesting that
Chaetogaster limnaei, a known commensal of gastropods (Sankwathri and Holmes
1976, Fernandez et al. 1991), was not collected at our sites until after Dreissena became
established (Tables 2 and 3). Beedham (1970) described a symbiotic relationship
between the chironomid larva Metriocnemus and Dreissena, in which chironomids
lived within and upon shells of living Dreissena, possibly feeding upon mucal body
secretions. This genus was not collected in our study, but other chironomids may be
taking advantage of Dreissena in a similar way.
Our study failed to show that Dreissena is negatively affecting other benthic macroinvertebrate
taxa of southwestern Lake Ontario (Tables 2 and 3). These results are
encouraging in light of concern that Dreissena has generated since it invaded North
America. Dreissena is known to settle on the bodies of decapods (Sebestyen 1938),
impairing movement and occasionally piercing the decapod exoskeleton with byssal
fibers (Lamanova 1971). Goniobasis livescens (Stewart, personal observation) is also
colonized. Fortunately, decapods discard mussels upon molting, and most other taxa
are too small and short-lived to become heavily colonized. No decapod collected in
our study was observed to be carrying Dreissena.
Studies conducted within the Great Lakes do suggest Dreissena is threatening bivalves
of the family Unionidae by settling on their shells and possibly inhibiting their ability
to feed, respire, and reproduce (Hebert et al. 1989, Hebert et al. 1991, Mackie 1991,
Schloesser and Kovalak 1991, Hunter and Bailey 1992). There is additional concern
that removal of suspended organic matter by Dreissena will also imperil unionids
dependent upon this food source (Hebert et al. 1991). While the dome suction sampler
was unable to collect large unionids in our study, both large and small unionids were
observed at the cobble site in 1991-92, and few zebra mussels were attached to them.
Unionids collected by hand at the cobble site included Elliptio complanata, Lampsilis
radiata, and Ligumia sp.
While most macroinvertebrate population changes observed in our study may be attributable
to Dreissena, these changes may also reflect changes in water quality (Cook
and Johnson 1974, Sly 1991), habitat (Haynes and Makarewicz 1982) and thermal
regimes (Barton 1986) that were unrelated to the Dreissena invasion. Phosphorus
abatement programs have contributed to declines in total phosphorus concentrations
throughout Lake Ontario since the mid-1970s (Stevens and Neilson 1987, Great Lakes
Fishery Commission 1992), but assessing the effects that phosphorus abatement has
had and will continue to have on benthic macroinvertebrate populations is problematic.
Johnson and Mac-Neil (1986) attributed declines in the abundances of some
oligochaete, sphaeriid bivalve and isopod taxa in the Bay of Quinte to the reductions
in phosphorus loading to Lake Ontario. Barton (1986) observed declines in total benthic
macroinvertebrate abundance in areas undergoing rapid deeutrophica-tion, but
noted that species diversity often increased under such conditions. Increased overall
abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates, including at least one taxon (Spirosperma
ferox) known to inhabit nutrient-rich habitats (Klemm 1985), suggest nutrient deposition
by Dreissena has more than compensated for oligotrophication processes in
southwestern Lake Ontario benthic environments between 1983 and 1991-1992. Increased
water clarity resulting from declining phosphorus concentrations, in combination
with Dreissena filter-feeding, also may lead to a deeper and warmer epilimnion (Mazumder
1990) which may increase benthic production.
Since the artificial reef was only a year old when its macroinvertebrate fauna were
first sampled in 1983 (Bader 1985), many taxa may not have had sufficient opportunity
to colonize the site or to attain stable population densities by that time. It is also
conceivable that natural processes of primary succession have altered physical characteristics
of the artificial reef, making the structure more or less favorable over time for
certain taxa. Despite these possibilities, community changes at the long established
cobble site appeared more extensive than at the artificial reef (Table 4), suggesting
that age of study site cannot explain changes measured in our study. 
Many benthic macroinvertebrate populations are irregularly distributed (Elliott 1971)
or vary greatly in seasonal abundance. Since any sampling is likely to miss rare taxa,
and the ecological requirements of the taxa not collected in 1983 or 1991-1992 (Tables
2 and 3) are diverse (Simpson and Bode 1980, Clarke 1981), the absence of many rare
taxa is likely due to sampling anomalies or chance. However, the absence of Musculium
partumeium at the artificial reef site in 1991-1992 (Table 3) is understandable
since this species prefers silty or muddy substrate rather than rock (Mackie et al. 1980,

In summary, Dreissena was the overwhelmingly dominant benthic macroinvertebrate
taxon at cobble and artificial reef sites in southwestern Lake Ontario by 1991-1992.
Nevertheless, overall abundance of other benthic macroinvertebrates, and the number
of taxa collected, were greater in both habitats following establishment of Dreissena
populations. By occurring in large clumps and filter-feeding intensively, Dreissena
may benefit other macroinvertebrate taxa by increasing the complexity of benthic substrate
and by increasing the flow of energy to benthic environments. Thus an increase
in benthic photosynthesis (due to increased water clarity caused by nutrient reduction
programs and Dreissena biofiltration), along with biodeposition by Dreissena, may be
keeping benthic food resources at high levels, despite overall declines in fertility of the
Lake Ontario ecosystem. This study failed to provide evidence that Dreissena has induced
population declines in any taxon collected at cobble or artificial reef sites in
1983. It appears that invasion of Dreissena and other recent environmental changes
have created conditions more favorable for most benthic macroinvertebrate taxa in
nearshore regions of southwestern Lake Ontario.
