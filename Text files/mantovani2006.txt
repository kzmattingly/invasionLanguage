xabstract
The Sacca di Goro is a shallow, brackish, eutrophic coastal lagoon in the southernmost part
of the Po River Delta (northern Adriatic Sea, Italy). It is heavily exploited for rearing the
Manila clam (Tapes philippinarum), mean annual production since 1986 being 10 000 t.
Commercial cultivation of bivalves can exert severe impact on a local environment, especially
on the invertebrate community, reducing species richness and abundance. An in situ
experiment was conducted from March 2003 to February 2004 to examine the effect of clam
cultivation on the macrobenthic community. Replicated sites within an area licensed for
clam farming were seeded with low (500 m2) and high (1500 m2) clam densities; the
surrounding unseeded areas were used as a control. There were only weak effects of
clam presence and density on macrobenthic community abundance and functional group
composition. The main determinants regulating the macrobenthic community were seasonal
variations in other biota, particularly proliferation of the invasive mussel, Musculista
senhousia, in August, which in turn caused a significant increase in the biomass of surface
deposit-feeders and the subsequent development of Ulva rigida beds in September.

xintroduction
There has been increasing recent interest in evaluating the
collateral effects of commercial cultivation of bivalves on
the local marine environment (Sorokin et al., 1999; Bartoli
et al., 2001; Jie et al., 2001; Dame et al., 2002), especially
on macrobenthic communities (Kaiser et al., 1996; Drake
and Arias, 1997; Spencer et al., 1997; Gaspar et al.,
2002, 2003). The main effect on non-target species is
a reduction in species richness and abundance (Commito,
1987; Dittman, 1990; Guenther, 1996; Ragnarsson and
Raffaelli, 1999; Beadman et al., 2004; Pranovi et al.,
2004), although in some cases the opposite effect has
been recorded. This was caused by the use of plastic nets
to protect clams from predation by shorebirds and crabs
(Spencer et al., 1992), which increased sedimentation rates
and consequently the density of some species of infaunal
deposit-feeding worms (Spencer et al., 1997).
This study was carried out in the Sacca di Goro, a shallow,
brackish, eutrophic coastal lagoon located in the southernmost
part of the Po River Delta (northern Adriatic Sea, Italy); the
surface area is some 26 km2 and the average depth 1.5 m.
The lagoon receives freshwater input rich in organic and mineral
nutrients, derived from urban effluents and agricultural
run-off. These factors are responsible for important alterations
in ecosystem functioning characterized by eutrophic and dystrophic
conditions in summer, algal blooms, oxygen depletion,
and hydrogen sulphide production (Giordani et al.,
1997; Viaroli et al., 2001). Clam farming has been practiced
continuously in the lagoon since 1986 (Carrieri et al.,
1992), and the mean annual yield has been 10 000 t. Clams
are cultivated in licensed areas covering approximately
9 km2 of the lagoon surface. Approximately 1.5e2 km2
are intensively cultivated at a density of >500 m2 (Rossi,
2000).
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rearing
clams, at low and high stocking densities, on the macrobenthic
community, and on the taxonomic and functional
composition of the community throughout an annual cycle,
from seeding to harvesting.


xmethods
Study area
The experiment was carried out for 11 months, starting on
12 March 2003 (the preferred seeding month) and ending
on 12 February 2004, within an area licensed for clam
farming (Figure 1) in the Sacca di Goro. The experimental
area was selected with regard to sandy/silty sediment characteristics,
linked to a hydrodynamic regime that allows optimal
clam growth and survival (Rossi, 2000). Before
seeding, existing clams were removed from the experimental
site by professional fishers.
The study area (400 m2) was divided into subunits
(Figure 2), left (Le) and right (R), seeded with clams of average
length 19  2 mm and weight 1.65  0.51 g, at low
(L) 500 m2 and high (H) 1500 m2 densities, for four
treatments, respectively, labelled LLe, HLe, LR, and HR.
The experimental area that remained unseeded served as
a control (CR and CLe).
Clam sampling and analysis
Samples were collected monthly in each of the four cultivated
sites from 12 March 2003 to 12 February 2004. Triplicate
samples were taken randomly using two square
frames, 40 cm side for the 500-m2 density seeding, and
20 cm side for the 1500-m2 density seeding, designed to
allow collection of adequate sample sizes, based on a pilot
survey (data not shown). The sediment inside the frame was
collected to a depth of 25 cm, and the samples were washed
through a net (5-mm mesh) to remove the clams. These
were transferred quickly to the laboratory where individual
lengths and weights were measured.
Macrobenthic community sampling
and analysis
Triplicate samples were collected with a van Veen grab
(area 0.06 m2) with a penetration depth of 12 cm (approximately
10 cm at the edge) at each site in March, April,
June, August, and September, when macroalgal blooms
and related dystrophic events were likely, and in February,
after winter. Samples were filtered rapidly through a sieve
of 0.5-mm mesh, and the material retained was fixed in
8% buffered formalin and stained with Rose Bengal to
facilitate sorting and identification. Each item was identified
to species level when possible, using standard reference
texts. The numbers of each taxon were recorded. The functional
group for each taxon was defined, and the biomass
was determined as ash-free dry weight (dw), after drying
at 100(C for 24 h and burning at 450(C for 5 h.
When present in the sample, the macroalga Ulva rigida
was separated from the sediment, and its biomass determined
as dry weight, after drying at 100(C for 24 h.
Data analysis
Macroinvertebrate community structure was assessed on
the basis of abundance, biomass, species richness (Margalef’s
d index), diversity (Shannon’s H index), evenness
(Pielou’s J index), and functional group composition. Differences
between L and H density and control sites, i.e.
the effect of the factors ‘‘site’’ and ‘‘density’’, or between
the sampling dates (factor ‘‘month’’), considering separately
macrofauna, and clam length and weight, were tested
with MANOVA. Normality of data was assumed, and
homoscedasticity was tested using Cochran’s test. Post-hoc
comparisons were performed using a Tukey test.
The overall percentage contribution of each species to
the average dissimilarity between ‘‘densities’’ and ‘‘times’’
was ascertained using SIMPER (PRIMER ecological statistical
software package; Clarke and Warwick, 1994).
To analyse benthic communities, clams were removed,
because they were sampled and analysed separately.

xresults
Manila clams
The Manila clam seeding densities of 500 and 1500 m2 remained
constant throughout the study period. Clams grew
exponentially, reaching commercial size (D.P.R. 1639/68,
Marine Fisheries Law) in October, at average lengths of
35.4 and 36.4 mm, corresponding to average weights of
10.54 and 12.15 g, respectively, at H and L densities.
Macrozoobenthic community
The statistical analysis of macrozoobenthic community data
(abundance, biomass, richness, diversity, evenness, and
functional groups) revealed no significant effect (F1,5 ¼
1.421; p > 0.05) of the factor ‘‘site’’, i.e. there were no differences
between Le and R, L and H density, and control,
so the data from replicated sites were pooled. Consequently,
results are presented as the average of six replicates
for each site (L, H, and C) for density and month,
for the parameters listed above.
The macrozoobenthic species list, compiled over all sampling
periods, consisted of 28 taxa (Table 1). Variations in
total abundance (Figure 3) were not significantly different
(F2,90 ¼ 1.626; p > 0.05) in the cultivated sites or control,
except in August, when the control (25 782 m2) and
H density (22 804 m2) experienced a reduction (F5,90 ¼
5.717; p < 0.01) not found at the L-density sites. In September
all plots contained lower densities than in June
(F5,90 ¼ 6.012; p < 0.01) and February (F5,90 ¼ 5.199;
p < 0.01).
The biomass data followed the same pattern of no significant
difference between sites (F2,90 ¼ 1.849; p > 0.05), with
the lowest value in September (F5,90 ¼ 7.187; p < 0.01), but
complete recovery in February (F5,90 ¼ 9.159; p < 0.01).
SIMPER showed that the dominant taxa (90% of total
abundance) in all treatments throughout the study period
were the polychaetes Polydora ciliata, Capitella capitata,
Prionospio multibranchiata, and Streblospio shrubsolii, together
with the amphipods Microdeutopus gryllotalpa and
Ampelisca sp., showing average dissimilarities never higher
than 40%. SIMPER also revealed a trend of increasing
complexity, as four species (S. shrubsolii, P. multibranchiata,
C. capitata, and N. succinea) contributed 90% of
the similarity in March. These four species increased to
five in April, six in June, and seven in August and September,
in relation to the successive appearance of the amphipods
Ampelisca sp., M. gryllotalpa, and Gammarus spp.,
respectively.
Community indices are reported in Table 2. Shannon’s
index increased significantly (F5,90 ¼ 23.894; p < 0.01)
from March to June, decreased in August (F5,90 ¼ 18.544;
p < 0.01) in H and C, and increased (F5,90 ¼ 9.111;
p < 0.01) in February 2004, in all treatments. A parallel
trend was revealed for Pielou’s index, with the lowest
values in August (F5,90 ¼ 12.170; p < 0.01) in H and C.
Margalef’s index increased (F5,90 ¼ 23.709; p < 0.01)
over the sampling period.
Functional group composition indicated a strong dominance
of surface deposit-feeders (SDF), mainly S. shrubsolii
and P. multibranchiata (Figure 4). The density of SDF
showed a parallel trend in H and L density, and C, in all
months except August, when L (36 710 m2) was significantly
higher (F2,90 ¼ 3.299; p > 0.05) than H (16 403 m2)
and C (19 209 m2). Subsurface deposit-feeders (SSDF)
remained stable throughout the study period, densities ranging
from 700 to 2000 m2, but increased significantly
(F5,90 ¼ 3.614; p < 0.05) in February (4174, 7689, and
7634 m2). Filter-feeders (FF) were present at densities
<200 m2. They peaked in August (F5,90 ¼ 40.429;
p < 0.01), reaching densities of 4865, 4637, and 5260 m2,
in H, L, and C, respectively, and decreased (F5,90 ¼ 31.981;
p < 0.01) in September (600e2000 m2) and February
(900e1500 m2). Further, the mussel Musculista senhousia,
rarely found from March to June (0e60 m2), built extended
mats in H- (3688 m2) and L-density (4643 m2) cultivated
sites, and in C (3928 m2) during August.
Ulva rigida biomass
Ulva rigida was observed in the experimental area in
August (Figure 5), in the sites with H density first, with
a biomass of 52 and 20 g dw m2, respectively, for HLe
and HR. In September the macroalgal bed completely covered
the area, with a biomass varying from 31 (in HR) to
364 g dw m2 (in LR). In February, the experimental area
was completely devoid of algae.


xdiscussion
Invertebrate abundance in temperate soft-bottom habitats
usually varies seasonally, with two peaks typically in spring
and autumn (Guelorget and Michel, 1979; Castel et al., 1989;
Arias and Drake, 1994). In the Sacca di Goro lagoon, such
temporal fluctuation was constantly disturbed by clam rearing,
because the licensed areas cover >30% of the surface
and the remaining part is variably exposed to some activity,
such as harvesting naturally settled adult clams and/or spat.
In common with other coastal habitats subjected to heavy
fishing stress (Auster et al., 1996; Frid et al., 1996; Jennings
and Kaiser, 1998), it is difficult to identify control sites where
the benthic community is undisturbed. Consequently, in the
present study, the control site selected was an area not
recently affected by clam farming, but potentially indirectly
affected by disturbance in nearby parts of the lagoon. A previous
study on the effects of manual harvesting on a clamcultivation
area of the Sacca di Goro lagoon showed recovery
within a month of harvesting (Castaldelli et al., 2003). Therefore,
as the control site had not been exposed to direct
anthropogenic disturbance for a year prior to the experiment
(March 2003), the resident macrobenthic community was
considered to be undisturbed.
Previous studies on the effects of bivalve cultivation on
non-target species identified significant alteration of community
structure, in the form of reduced diversity and richness
(Commito, 1987; Dittman, 1990; Guenther, 1996;
Ragnarsson and Raffaelli, 1999; Beadman et al., 2004; Pranovi
et al., 2004), or more specific effects on particular
taxa, principally on burrow-dwelling invertebrates (Flach,
1996; Spencer et al., 1996). The main causes of these
changes are ascribable to the presence of unstable sediments,
common in bivalve cultivation areas, owing to the
high rates of deposition of faeces and pseudo-faeces, movement
of bivalves (Kautsky and Evans, 1987), and the lack
of space for burrow construction (Jensen and Kirstensen,
1990).
In this study, significant differences in density, biomass,
and functional group composition were found rarely between
treatments and control. The macrozoobenthic community
appeared to be dominated by highly tolerant
opportunistic species of small size, high motility, and short
life cycle, as reported by Mistri et al. (2001) for locations of
the Sacca di Goro outside the licensed clam-cultivation
areas, and in other European lagoons and embayments subjected
to trawling and mollusc-farming (Drake and Arias,
1997; Mistri et al., 2000; Thrush et al., 2001). In our experimental
site, small polychaetes (<3 mm long) dominated,
in both cultivated and control areas, indicating the absence
of spatial limitation of clams evident in other environments
(Jensen and Kirstensen, 1990).
Clam presence and density seemingly did not affect the
temporal fluctuation of invertebrate abundance and functional
group composition, in apparent contrast to studies
conducted in the United Kingdom (Kaiser et al., 1996;
Spencer et al., 1996, 1997), where plastic nets, protecting
clams from crabs and shorebirds, enhanced sedimentation
rates and deposit-feeder densities (Spencer et al., 1992).
Other bivalve cultivation techniques, such as American
hard-shell clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) being placed in
net bags on intertidal shores (Mojica and Nelson, 1993),
or mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), suspended in largemesh
plastic sacks (Nizzoli et al., 2005), increase accumulation
of particulate organic matter in the sediment,
resulting in reduced diversity of natural macrofaunal assemblages,
and favouring the dominance of small, hypoxiae
anoxia tolerant, species (Haven and Morales-Alamo, 1966;
Dame et al., 1980). Nets are not necessary in the subtidal,
naturally sheltered, clam-farming areas in the Sacca di
Goro, and marine vivification was recently increased by
dredging many channels adjacent to rearing sites, favouring
the flushing of faeces and pseudo-faeces from the area.
The potential effect of organic matter accumulation became
evident during the rapid increase of filter-feeders
recorded in August (Figure 4), owing to the presence
of the mussel Musculista senhousia, which did not
affect our experiment, i.e. clam densities altering clam
growth and/or mortality (Mistri, 2004). Extended mats
of M. senhousia retained more organic matter on the
sediment, and this modified the benthic community
composition, favouring detritivores such as S. shrubsolii, as
already reported (Crooks, 2001; Mistri, 2003). One of the
highest SDF abundances (36 710 m2, mainly S. shrubsolii
and P. multibranchiata) was recorded in the L-density site,
concomitant with the highest M. senhousia abundance
(4643 m2).
In the same period, there was a significant decrease of
SDF and an increase of amphipods (M. gryllotalpa and
Gammarus spp.) in plots H and C, in relation to the appearance
(August) and development (September), of the macroalga
U. rigida, reducing also the abundance of M. senhousia
(F5,90 ¼ 36.429; p < 0.01). Surface deposit-feeders are the
group that is most sensitive to the presence of macroalgal
beds, being negatively affected by the reduction of oxygen
related to algal respiration and enhanced bacterial activity
(Norkko and Bondsdorff, 1996; Osterling and Pihl, 2001).
A study conducted in other areas of the Sacca di Goro lagoon
failed to show significant correlations between Gracilaria
verrucosa biomass and macroinvertebrate community
parameters. Dystrophic events were not recorded, and the
only negative effect was on the dominant bivalve species,
Cerastoderma glaucum, which suffered from physical interference
with filter-feeding activity, as hypothesized by
Mistri et al. (2001). In the licensed clam-farming areas,
G. verrucosa thalli were rarely found, while Ulva spp.
accumulation, decomposition, and related dystrophic crises
took place for many years (Viaroli et al., 1992, 2001,
2003), leading to mass mortality of clams and non-target
benthic fauna (Rossi, 2000).
At the experimental site, rapid development of U. rigida
and its crash at the end of summer appeared to be the strongest
disturbance, indicating that August and September
were the most dominant months for this alga, as confirmed
by diversity and evenness values which were lower than
those registered after the cold season (February).
The benthic community in clam-culture areas of the
Sacca di Goro lagoon presented a characteristic composition
and structure, established by a 20-year chronic regime
of anthropogenic disturbance, owing to both eutrophication-
related phenomena and clam-rearing practices. In the
present situation, sudden and unpredictable events, such
as the rapid development and disappearance of M. senhousia
and U. rigida at the end of summer, appeared much
more influential in regulating macrofaunal assemblages
within clam-cultivation sites, than the clams.
