xabstract
Surveys of benthic macroinvertebrates conducted in Lake Ontario during 1994 and 1997 revealed recent declines
in populations of three major taxonomic groups: Oligochaeta, Sphaeriidae, and Diporeia spp. (Amphipoda), with the most
drastic reductions occurring in the latter. Results from sediment measurements were used to classify deepwater sediments
into three habitat zones. Densities of all three taxa declined in the shallowest (12–88 m) of the sediment zones between 1994
and 1997; the greatest changes in density were observed for Diporeia, which declined from 3011 to 145 individuals·m–2, and
for total benthic macroinvertebrates, which declined from 5831 to 1376 individuals·m–2. Mean densities of Dreissena spp. in
1997 were highest in the shallowest zone, and the areas of greatest densities corresponded to areas of largest reductions in
Diporeia populations. We believe that dreissenids are competing with Diporeia by intercepting the supply of fresh algae essential
for Diporeia survival. A decline in macroinvertebrate densities, especially populations of an important food item such
as Diporeia, in Lake Ontario sediments at depths of 12–88 m may have a detrimental impact on the benthic food web.

xintroduction
The deepwater, benthic macroinvertebrate community of
the Great Lakes is dominated by a few species of organisms.
The cold–stenotherm association includes Oligochaeta, Sphaeriidae,
and Diporeia spp. (Cook and Johnson 1974). Two
species of oligochaetes, Stylodrilus heringianus and Limnodrilus
hoffmeisteri, are found throughout the offshore regions
and may account for 10–20% of the total benthic
population density (Mozley and Howmiller 1977). Members
of the bivalve family Sphaeriidae are usually found in waters
less than 90 m deep and account for 5–15% of the total benthic
population density. The amphipod Diporeia spp. (formerly
Pontoporeia hoyi) is the most abundant macroinvertebrate
(Mozley and Howmiller 1977; Nalepa 1991) in
the Great Lakes. In deeper water habitats, it accounts for
40–70% of the total density of benthic organisms (Nalepa
1991), reaching greatest densities at depths below the summer
thermocline in waters 30–60 m deep.
In the Great Lakes, Diporeia is found in greatest numbers
in soft or fine sediments and in sand overlain with a thin
layer of detritus (Marzolf 1965). An important source of
food for Diporeia arrives in the spring and fall when water
conditions favor diatom blooms and subsequent settling of
diatoms onto the sediments (Saether 1980). Diporeia depends
on settling algae for growth and reproduction, storing
the assimilated energy as lipid. Lipid levels of Diporeia are
high compared with those of other Great Lakes benthic macroinvertebrates
and can account for up to 50% of the amphipods’
dry weight after the spring diatom bloom (Gardner et
al. 1985). It has been estimated that within deeper water
habitats of the Great Lakes, 23% of the total annual carbon
production from phytoplankton is consumed by this organism
(Flint 1986). Fitzgerald and Gardner (1993) reported
that Diporeia ingested 61% of the spring diatom bloom in
Lake Michigan. A large portion of Diporeia biomass is
transferred up the food chain to forage fish. Diporeia is the
dominant food organism of the slimy sculpin in Lake Ontario
(Owens and Weber 1995) and most other fish species
feed on Diporeia at some stage in their life cycle (Mozley
and Howmiller 1977). Because of the importance of benthic
macroinvertebrates and particularly Diporeia in fish diets,
changes in the status of Diporeia or the other two major taxa
could have dramatic effects on fish production in the Great
Lakes.
Colonization by the dreissenid mussels Dreissena polymorpha
and Dreissena bugensis is probably one of the more
ecologically important events to occur in the Great Lakes
during the last decade (MacIsaac 1996). Since their discovery
in 1988, dreissenids have colonized both soft and hard substrates
to depths of 130 m (Mills et al. 1993) and reached
densities of 340 000·m–2 in some areas (Leach 1993). Because
of high densities, widespread distribution, and high filtering
rates, Dreissena populations can filter large volumes of water
and have the capacity to decrease algal biomass (Holland
1993; Fahnenstiel et al. 1995). Therefore, this diversion of
algal production into dreissenid tissue and biodeposits may
deprive Diporeia and other deepwater macroinvertebrates of
food settling from the water column.
In this study, we examined changes in densities of Diporeia,
Oligochaeta, and Sphaeriidae in Lake Ontario between 1994
and 1997 and relate these changes to those observed over the
past three decades. We present evidence that all three taxonomic
groups have declined in density in waters between 12
and 88 m at a time when Dreissena densities were increasing.


xmethods
Macroinvertebrate sampling design and processing
Benthic samples were collected from Lake Ontario in late August
1994 and early September 1997 at 55 and 75 stations, respectively
(Fig. 1). Sampling depths ranged from 12 to 213 m. Station
locations in 1994 and 1997 were based on a randomized design using
a systematic grid (Stevens 1997). Locations in 1994 were then
classified into habitat zones based on principal components analysis
(PCA) of physical and chemical data (see below). Because only a
subset of physical and chemical measurements were taken in 1997,
classification of these locations was based on grain size and depth,
two of the most important discriminating measurements as determined
by PCA. Position for sampling was determined by a Loran
C navigation.
At each station, three samples were taken with a Ponar grab
(area = 0.048 m2); the samples were pooled into a single sample,
placed into an elutriation device, and washed through a nylon
sleeve with a 500-mm opening (Mozley and Howmiller 1977). The
residue retained was preserved in 5% formalin containing rose bengal
stain. In the laboratory, organisms were initially removed from
samples under a dissecting microscope and identified into major
taxonomic groups. Later, organisms were identified to the lowest
possible taxonomic level. Dreissena were counted and identified to
species in 1997 but not in 1994.
Sediment collection and analysis
In 1994, an additional Ponar grab sample was collected from
each station and sediment from the top 2 cm, assumed to represent
the biologically active zone, was placed into clean glass containers
and kept at 5°C. These sediments were analyzed for grain size,
organic carbon, ammonia, sulfide, and relative toxicity. Standard
methods for grain size analysis and total organic carbon were followed
(ASTM 1991). Results for grain size were reported as percentage
clay (<4 mm), silt (4–60 mm), and sand (>60 mm). Ten-day
toxicity tests for Hyalella azteca and Chironomus tentans were
conducted according to standard methods (Ingersoll and Nelson
1990). Results were reported as percentage survival of organisms.
Measurements of pore-water ammonia and sulfide concentrations
followed methods of Ankley et al. (1993).
Statistical analysis
A principal components analysis (PCA, Wilkinson 1996) was
performed using physical and chemical characteristics of sediments
collected in 1994 to identify different macroinvertebrate habitat
zones. Variables included in the analysis were percentage survival
of Hyallela azteca and Chironomus tentans in toxicity tests, percentage
sand, silt, clay, and carbon, depth, ammonia, and sulfide.
Mean population densities in each zone (numbers of individuals·
m–2) and between year(s) were compared with analysis of variance
(ANOVA) and Tukey’s test (p £ 0.05) using densities at each station
as replicates (Wilkinson 1996). Water depth was included as a
covariate term. Variance stabilizing transformations were used
prior to data analysis. An arcsine – square root transformation was
used for percentage data and a log transformation was used for
macroinvertebrate density data.


xresults
Sediment analysis
Results from PCA indicate that the first principal component
accounted for 40% of total variability with depth, %
sand, and % silt being the variables that correlated most
highly with the first axis (Table 1). In general, sand and silt
accounted for the majority of dry sediment mass at all stations,
with clay comprising <2% of the remaining sediment
mass at each site. Thus deepwater stations with high amounts
of silt and clay are located to the right of where the PC1 and
PC2 axes intersect (Fig. 2). As a result, a strong negative
correlation exists between sand and silt such that areas with
high % sand have low % silt, and vice versa. The second
principal component accounted for 14% of the variability
with percentage survival of H. azteca, ammonia, and sulfide
levels being most highly correlated with the second axis.
The results of PCA for habitat characteristics with the 1994
data revealed three groupings of stations (Table 1, Fig. 2).
The three groupings were identified as low-depositional,
transitional, and high-depositional areas (Table 1, Figs. 1,
2). The low-depositional zone included stations with a high
ratio of sand to silt and low % carbon; these stations were
generally located in shallower, nearshore regions (12–88 m).
The high-depositional zone was characterized by stations with
sediments of a higher ratio of silt to sand and high % clay relative
to sediments from other stations. High-depositional
stations were deeper (90–213 m) and located centrally in the
lake. The transitional zone included stations with sediments
having a mixture of sand and silt and % clay that was intermediate
between low- and high-depositional stations. Depths
in this zone were intermediate (63–91 m) and stations were
located between the low-depositional and high-depositional
zone (Fig. 1, 2). Three stations (stations 142, 152, and 164)
were intermediate in sand and silt but located in deeper water,
i.e., greater than 134 m (Fig. 1). These stations were
located on the Whitby–Olcott and Scotch Bonnet sills
(Thomas et al. 1972) that separate the Lake Ontario basin
into three deepwater high-depositional zones. For macroinvertebrate
analysis, stations located on the sills were
placed in the high-depositional group.
Macroinvertebrate densities
Three taxa, Diporeia spp., Oligochaeta, and Sphaeriidae,
comprised 91–99% of all macroinvertebrates collected in
1994 and 1997. There were significant differences for major
taxa within sediment zones. In the low-depositional zone,
densities of Diporeia were most abundant at depths greater
than 42 m in 1994 but no pattern was discernable along the
depth gradient sampled in 1997 (Table 2). At stations where
Diporeia were abundant, densities averaged 6363·m2 in
1994 compared with 954·m2 in 1997. Further, the percentage
of stations where no or very few Diporeia (<5 m2) were
found increased from 40% in 1994 to 84% in 1997. In the
transitional and high-depositional zones, there was little association
between depth and Diporeia densities in 1994 or
1997, and at stations where Diporeia were abundant, densities
were comparable. There were no apparent patterns
between densities of Oligochaeta or Sphaeriidae and depth
within any of the three sediment zones.
Results from ANOVA of mean densities with main effects
of differences between years and sediment zones were statistically
significant for all three taxa and total macroinvertebrate
density with p-values of 0.001–0.008. The
covariate term water depth was never a significant factor in
the ANOVA with p-values of 0.146–0.504. Densities of
Diporeia, Oligochaeta, and Sphaeriidae and total macroinvertebrates
were significantly (Tukey’s test) lower in 1997
compared with 1994 in the low-depositional zone (Table 3),
with percentage declines of 95, 61, 45, and 76%, respectively.
Densities of Oligochaeta, but not Diporeia and
Sphaeriidae, were significantly lower in 1997 compared with
1994 in the high-depositional zone, with a percentage decline
of 58%. Another general trend, although not always
statistically significant, was for densities to be lower in the
high-depositional zone compared with the other two sediment
zones for all three taxa and total macroinvertebrates
(Table 3). In the transitional zone, there were no significant
differences in densities of the three taxa and total abundance
between years and other sediment zones. The lack of significant
differences may be partially due to the small number of
stations located in this zone.
The spatial distribution pattern of Diporeia was different
between 1994 and 1997, especially in the low-depositional
zone. In 1994, highest population densities were found at stations
located along the northern shoreline and at the far eastern
end of the lake (Fig. 3a). A contiguous zone of stations
with population densities of <4 individuals·m–2 occurred
along the southeastern shore between the Genessee River outlet
and Mexico Bay. In 1997, the number of stations with
population densities of <4 individuals·m–2 increased and these
stations extended all around the lake. The exception was Station
62 near Toronto where densities were 1311·m–2. In some
areas, this depauperate zone extended as far as 26 km offshore
and to a depth of 160 m and encompassed over 40% of
the total area of the lake. The most severe effect was along
the southern and eastern shoreline from the outlet of the Niagara
River to Point Petre, where Diporeia were absent from
samples collected in waters 140 m deep or less.
In 1994, there were large numbers (>5000·m–2) of oligochaetes
near the mouths of the Niagara (Station 201) and
Genessee (Station 172) rivers and along Point Petre (Station
81, Fig. 3b). Stylodrilus heringianus was the most abundant
oligochaete at these stations, accounting for over 30% of the
total number. In 1997, the spatial pattern of Oligochaeta was
similar to 1994 but with lower numbers in the lowdepositional
and high-depositional zones. Relatively high
population densities of Sphaeriidae were present at stations
located near the Kingston basin (Fig. 3c) in 1994. In 1997,
the spatial pattern of Sphaeriidae was different from 1994
with fewer organisms near the eastern end of the lake.
Ponar grab samplers were used to estimate densities of
dreissenids in 1997. Although dreissenids were present in
1994, the mussels were not collected or counted. The efficiency
of this sampler for collecting attached mussels has
not been quantified so our results are a relative measure of
population density and distribution. Mean densities of Dreissena
polymorpha and D. bugensis in 1997 were highest in
the low-depositional zone, intermediate in the transitional
zone, and lowest in the high-depositional zone (Table 4).
Neither species of Dreissena was abundant in waters deeper
than 70 m. Stations along the south shore from the outlet of
the Niagara River to Mexico Bay had the largest numbers of
Dreissena in waters less than 40 m deep (Fig. 4). There were
also large numbers of Dreissena near Port Hope, Ontario,
and in the Kingston basin. Species richness (mean number
of species·site–1) in waters <40 m was greater at stations
where Dreissena were present (10.1 ± 0.4 (mean ± SE),
t test, p < 0.05) compared with stations where Dreissena were
absent (6.4 ± 0.3). Several species of Naididae (Chaetogaster
diaphanus, Ophidonais serpentina, Stylaria lacustris,
Vejdovskyella intermedia), Tubificidae (Potamothrix
moldaviensis, P. vejdovskyi, Rhyacodrilus coccineus,
Spirosperma ferox), and Chironomidae (Heterotrissocladius
sp., Chironomus sp., Cryptochironomus sp., Paracladopelma
sp., Paralauterborniella sp., Tribelos sp., Micropsectra sp.,
Tanytarsus sp.) were more abundant or only found in stations
where dreissenids were present.

xdiscussion
Our data suggest a large change in total and relative density
of the macroinvertebrate community in Lake Ontario for
areas of the lake deeper than 12 m. If Dreissena spp. are excluded
from population estimates, our data indicate a major
decline in total macroinvertebrate densities between 1994
and 1997 in the low-depositional zone (12–88 m). Our results
contrast those summarized by Nalepa (1991), who
found no change in macroinvertebrate densities in shallow
waters (10–35 m) between 1964 and 1988 and an increase in
numbers of Diporeia in the Kingston basin. To allow comparisons
to these earlier studies, we grouped our densities of
Diporeia, Oligochaeta, and Sphaeriidae by the three depth
intervals (Table 5) used by Nalepa (1991) for the two Lake
Ontario surveys and tested for differences between years
(analysis of variance, ANOVA, Tukey’s test, p < 0.05) in
each depth interval. These comparisons are important because
the surveys of Hiltunen (1969) and Nalepa and Thomas (1976)
were completed before the invasion of Dreissena.
In the shallow depth interval, Diporeia, Oligochaeta, and
Sphaeriidae were significantly lower in 1997 compared with
densities found in 1964 and 1972 (Table 5). Mean densities
of Diporeia were at least 130 times greater in 1964 and 1972
than in 1997, while mean densities of Sphaeriidae and
Oligochaeta were at least nine times greater in 1964 and
1972 than in 1997. The mean density of Diporeia in 1994
was 40·m–2 but the lack of statistically significant differences
compared with earlier surveys is partially due to the small
number of stations (n = 4) sampled in the shallow depth interval
(10–35 m). In the intermediate depth interval, densities
of Diporeia were significantly greater in 1972 and 1994
(2131–4537·m–2) than in 1997 (1282·m–2). Mean densities of
Diporeia were much greater in 1964 (9077·m–2) than in
1997 but the lack of statistical significance is also partially
due to the small number of stations (n = 2) sampled in the
intermediate depth interval (36–90 m) in 1964. In the deepest
depth interval, results were mixed. Densities of Diporeia
were variable but never significantly different between
years. Densities of Oligochaeta and Sphaeriidae were significantly
greater in 1964 than in 1972, 1994, and 1997 but
there were no consistent trends after 1972. The spatial distribution
of stations where Diporeia were absent in Lake Ontario
sediments was similar in 1964 and 1972, i.e., the area
extended along the south shore from the Niagara River eastward
to Rochester, N.Y. (Hiltunen 1969; Nalepa and
Thomas 1976). In 1997, we found the area where Diporeia
was absent to have expanded to all areas around the lake in
waters between 10–40 m and down to a depth of 140 m in
the zone from the Niagara River eastward and northward to
Point Petre, Ont. In addition to whole-lake surveys, Nalepa
(1991) also provided a compilation of Lake Ontario benthic
studies showing trends from a nearshore area (Kingston basin)
of Lake Ontario before the invasion of Dreissena.
Between 1964 and 1988, Diporeia densities in the
Kingston basin (28–35 m) of Lake Ontario were variable.
Populations fluctuated between 3000·m–2 and 10 000·m–2
during the period of 1964 to 1984 and then rose to
13 900·m–2 by 1988. We found a mean population of
Diporeia of less than 1·m–2 at six stations (stations 1–7) in
the Kingston basin in 1997. Overall, the greatest change
from 1964 to the present is a lake-wide decline in density of
Diporeia down to depths of 140 m and lower densities of all
three taxa in the shallow depth interval (10–35 m) and the
low-depositional zone.
After the invasion of Dreissena spp. into the Great Lakes,
ecosystem changes included loss of edible particles (e.g.,
phytoplankton) and subsequent decline of phytoplankton
consumers, diversion of material from the open water to surface
sediments as bivalve tissue and biodeposits, and subsequent
increase of benthic resources in and around mussel
beds (Strayer et al. 1999; Haynes et al. 1999). The negative
impact of Dreissena spp. on Diporeia and other benthic
macroinvertebrate species is attributed to its high filtering
capacity and large population densities. Since their introduction
to Lake Ontario in 1988 or 1989, Dreissena populations
have expanded, reaching densities of 82 000·m–2 in Lake
Ontario by 1998 (Schaner 1998). Increased water clarity and
declines in phytoplankton density are directly correlated
with increased densities of Dreissena in Lake Erie and Lake
Huron (Fahnenstiel et al. 1995). Mean densities of planktonic
diatoms were reduced by 80–92% compared with premussel
periods in Hatchery Bay, western Lake Erie (Holland
1993). Although the reduction of diatom biomass could be
the result of other system changes (e.g., reduced phosphorus
loadings), concentrations of phosphorus in the open waters
of Lake Ontario have remained approximately 10 mg·L–1
since 1985 (Neilson et al. 1995).
Some of our results contrast those of Haynes et al. (1999),
who found greater densities of Gammarid amphipods but no
long-term changes in densities of oligochaetes and other
species of macroinvertebrates at 7 m in cobble and artificial
substrates after colonization by Dreissena in Lake Ontario.
We found densities of three taxa to be lower in the lowdepositional
zone and shallow water interval (10–35 m) of
Lake Ontario but species richness to be greater at stations
where Dreissena were present. The diversion of algae, especially
diatoms, from open waters to mussel beds and hard
substrates and incorporated into bivalve tissue and biodeposits
would benefit species that can use the shells for habitat and
(or) biodeposits for food.
Changes in benthic populations in deep lakes have been
attributed to trends in water column productivity (Saether
1980) because the density of the benthos is directly related
to the amount of food material settling from the water column.
Earlier studies have shown that the amphipod
Gammarus fasciatus, a shallow water species (<10 m), increased
after invasion of mussels in southwestern Lake Ontario
(Stewart and Haynes 1994; Haynes et al. 1999). The
authors suggested that Gammarus fasciatus growth is facilitated
by the additional food source from pseudofeces/feces
deposited by Dreissena and additional habitat provided by
mussel shells. Unlike Gammarus, Diporeia does not actively
feed on Dreissena fecal pellets (Lydy and Landrum 1993). It
has been shown that Diporeia is a discriminating feeder requiring
a high quality food in the spring (diatoms) to complete
its life cycle (Dermott and Corning 1988; Gardner et
al. 1985). The inability of Diporeia to use Dreissena biodeposits
as a food source and the reduction in its original
food source may have contributed to its decline. The large
decline in densities of Diporeia and other benthic macroinvertebrates
in Lake Ontario was most pronounced near areas
where dreissenids were most abundant and we postulate
that these declines could have resulted from a redirection of
energy from open waters to Dreissena beds.
Recent changes in densities of benthic macroinvertebrates
after invasion of Dreissena are not restricted to Lake Ontario.
Dramatic declines of Diporeia in deeper waters of
eastern Lake Erie also coincided with colonization by
dreissenids (Dermott and Kerec 1997). Mean densities of
Diporeia declined from 1844·m–2 in 1979 to 218·m–2 in
1993; Diporeia was found at all 13 deepwater stations in
1979 but only five stations in 1993. Dermott and Kerec
(1997) suggest that competition for diatoms between
Dreissena and Diporeia led to the exclusion of amphipods
from areas where Dreissena was abundant. In southern Lake
Michigan, Nalepa et al. (1998) reported declines of
Diporeia, Oligochaeta, and Sphaeriidae. Declines in oligochaetes
and sphaeriids occurred uniformly throughout the
nearshore region (<50 m), whereas declines of Diporeia
were greatest in the southeastern region of the lake. The region
where Diporeia declined more than 60% between 1980
and 1993 corresponded to areas where Dreissena was found
in largest numbers. Nalepa et al. (1998) also hypothesized
that the filtering activities of D. polymorpha were having a
negative impact on Diporeia.
In Lake Ontario, Diporeia populations are declining even
in areas with low dreissenid densities. Dreissena are not
present in large numbers at depths greater than 40 m; greatest
densities occur in waters less than 30 m. We hypothesize
that filtering capacity of dreissenids may be enhanced and
the reduction of Diporeia densities may be partially explained
by the seasonal occurrence of isolated water masses
in nearshore areas of the lake. The formation of a thermal
bar in spring and early summer isolates nearshore waters
from offshore waters. The progression of the thermal bar
from areas near the shoreline to deeper waters (>100 m) usually
begins in March and ends with the formation of the
summer thermocline (Thomas et al. 1972). During the spring
diatom bloom, diatoms shoreward of the thermal bar are exposed
to warmer, nutrient-rich water and, because the waters
are well mixed, are also exposed to the filtering activity of
Dreissena, thus allowing Dreissena to intercept diatoms before
they settle on deeper sediments. Scavia and Bennett
(1980) used field observations and simulation models to
demonstrate the relative importance of vertical mixing and
in situ production to observed nutrient and algal biomass in
Lake Ontario. During the spring, increased algal production
occurs on the shoreward side of the 4°C isotherm (Stadelmann
et al. 1974). The impact of dreissenids in the spring is
directly related to their filtering capacity.
The seasonal impact of dreissenids was assessed by estimating
their filtering capacity in comparison to volumes of
water isolated by the thermal bar. Bailey et al.’s (1999) filtration
model was used to calculate total turnover times (in
days) at different depth intervals as
T pi vi f ai xi
i
S
= × × ×
= å
[ ][ ]
1
where pi is the proportion of total bottom area in stratum i, vi
is the volume of stratum i, f is the filtering rate of an average-
sized mussel (100 mL·h–1·mussel–1), ai is the area of
bottom in stratum i, and xi is the density of mussels in stratum
i. Total turnover times were estimated from dreissenid
densities used by Bailey et al. (1999) and from Ponar data
collected in 1997 (Fig. 5). To obtain total turnover times, we
needed dreissenid densities at 1-m intervals; therefore, we
used regression analysis of dreissenid densities on depth to
find these values, i.e.,
log (xi) = 7.335 – 0.045·di
where di represents depth at stratum i. We found that total
turnover times were similar for depth intervals less than
30 m but much smaller based on our dreissenid estimates at
depth intervals between 30 and 75 m (Table 6). At depth intervals
greater than 80 m, Bailey et al.’s (1999) total turnover
times were substantially lower that those calculated from our
estimates of dreissenid densities. It is clear that better estimates
of dreissenid densities must be made before we can
determine the true potential effect of dreissenid filtering on
algal biomass in the spring. However, if our model and density
estimates are fairly accurate, isolated water masses in
Lake Ontario could be turned over in less than 10 days when
the thermal bar is located at depth contours of 60 m or less.
The loss of Diporeia from large areas of Lake Ontario
may be affecting fish production. Prey fish species such as
slimy sculpin use Diporeia as a key food source in Lake Ontario
(Owens and Weber 1995). Recently, there has been a
decline in populations of this fish species in U.S. waters; estimates
of densities of slimy sculpins have declined by 95%
between the late 1980s and 1996 (New York Department of
Environmental Conservation Annual Report 1998). Hoyle et
al. (1999) found a sharp decline in both densities and body
condition of lake trout and lake whitefish from the eastern
region of the lake (Kingston basin) after 1990, which corresponds
to the time that Diporeia were disappearing. In the
past, the Kingston basin had produced the largest fish yields
and supported a number of important commercial and sport
fisheries. In 1997, a single specimen of Diporeia was collected
from a total of 18 Ponar grab samples in the Kingston
basin, where mean densities of Diporeia reached levels of
14 000·m–2 before the invasion of Dreissena.
In summary, the status of the benthic macroinvertebrate
community of Lake Ontario has changed during the last 10
years. Densities of Diporeia, Oligochaeta, and Sphaeriidae
have declined in soft substrate habitats of deep water,
whereas dreissenid populations have increased in both hard
and soft sediments. A zone of very low Diporeia density (<4
individuals·m–2) extends as far as 26 km offshore and as
deep as 200 m, encompassing over 40% of the total surface
area of Lake Ontario soft sediments sampled in 1997. The
reduction of benthos, especially populations of Diporeia, in
the nearshore of Lake Ontario is expected to have a major
impact on the upper trophic levels of the lake.
