xabstract


We assessed changes in Lake Ontario zooplankton biomass, production, and community composition before

(1987ñ1991) and after (2001ñ2005) invasion-induced ecosystem changes. The ecosystem changes were

associated with establishment of invasive dreissenid mussels and invasive predatory cladocerans (Bythotrephes

and Cercopagis). Whole-lake total epilimnetic plus metalimnetic zooplankton production declined by

approximately half from 42.45 (g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1) during 1987ñ1991 to 21.91 (g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1) in

2003 and averaged 21.01 (g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1) during 2001ñ2005. Analysis of two independent data sets

indicates that the mean biomass and biomass proportion of cyclopoid copepods declined while the same

measures increased for the invasive predatory cladocerans. Changes in means and proportions of all other

zooplankton groups were not consistent between the data sets. Cyclopoid copepod biomass and production

declined by factors ranging from3.6 to 5.7. Invasive predatory cladoceran biomass averaged from5.0% to 8.0% of

the total zooplankton biomass. The zooplankton community was otherwise resilient to the invasion-induced

disruption as zooplankton species richness and diversity were unaffected. Zooplankton production was likely

reduced by declines in primary productivity but may have declined further due to increased predation by

alewives and invasive predatory cladocerans. Shifts in zooplankton community structure were consistent with

increased predation pressure on cyclopoid copepods by alewives and invasive predatory cladocerans. Predicted

declines in the proportion of small cladoceranswere not evident. This study represents the first direct comparison

of changes in Lake Ontario zooplankton production before and after the invasion-induced disruption andwill be

important to food web-scale investigations of invasion effects. xintroduction During the 1990s, invasive species disrupted the Lake Ontario food

web (Mills et al., 2003; O'Gorman et al., 2008; Stewart et al., 2009). The

disruption may have changed the zooplankton community. Some of the

changes have been documented (Johannsson, 2003;Warner et al., 2006;

Holeck et al., 2008), but to date, analyses have been insufficient to allow

for comparison of whole-lake scale changes in annual zooplankton

production associated with invasion. Previous studies only examined

changes to zooplankton production up to 1995 (Rand et al., 1995; Kuns

and Sprules, 2000; Johannsson, 2003). Additionally, Rand et al. (1995)

concluded that the consumptive demand of planktivorous prey fish

paradoxically exceeds zooplankton production in Lake Ontario by a

factor of 1.7, without accounting for invertebrate consumption of

zooplankton, suggesting possible underestimation of zooplankton

production.

Studies have yet to fully examine changes to Lake Ontario

zooplankton species richness and diversity associated with developing

populations of the predatory cladocerans Cercopagis pengoi and

Bythotrephes longimanus. Earlier assessments excluded Lake Ontario as

Bythotrephes abundance was low (Makarewicz and Jones, 1990;

Johannsson et al., 1991; Barbiero and Tuchman, 2004). Since that

time, Bythotrephes abundance remains low, but Cercopagis has become

well established (Holeck et al., 2008). In Lake Michigan, predation by

alewife is likely limiting Bythotrephes abundance but not Cercopagis

(Pothoven et al., 2007), and this may also be the case in Lake Ontario.

Bythotrephes and Cercopagis consume cyclopoid copepods and cladocerans

(WahlstromandWestman, 1999; Benoit et al., 2002; Laxon et al.,

2003). Declines in the abundance of small cladocerans and cyclopoid

copepods in Lake Ontario, after 1997, were attributed to Cercopagis

predation (Laxon et al., 2003; Warner et al., 2006), but the impacts on

species diversity and richness have not been assessed. Cyclopoid copepods and small cladocerans are also eaten by alewife (Urban and

Brandt, 1993; Mills et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 2009). It was predicted

that combined predation by alewife and invasive predatory cladocerans

would further shift the zooplankton community structure and may

cause disproportionate reductions in the abundance of cyclopoid

copepods and small cladocerans (Stewart et al., 2009). Updated and

improved estimates of annual zooplankton production and species

composition before and after invasive species disruption are needed to

evaluate these hypothesized effects and to facilitate food web scale

studies (Halfon et al., 1996; Rand et al., 1995).

The objectives of this studywere to assess changes in the magnitude

of zooplankton group biomass and production for two 5-year reference

time periods before (1987ñ1991) and after (2001ñ2005) the invasiveinduced

disruptive influences on the Lake Ontario food web. Improvements

were made to previous estimates of Lake Ontario zooplankton

production by correcting for species-specific variation in metalimnetic

production, included estimates of overwinter production, and

accounted for temperature-mediated whole-lake spatial variation in

production rates. Upper water column (epilimnion plus metalimnion)

zooplankton group biomass and production for the whole-lake was

estimated directly during 1987ñ1991. Changes in biomass ratios

between 1987ñ1991 and 2001ñ2005were used to calculate production

during the post-disruption time period. Potential changes in zooplankton

group biomass were assessed by comparing data collected during

1987ñ1991 and 2001ñ2005. In doing so, we tested the hypotheses that

1) zooplankton group biomass and total biomass declined after the food

web disruption, and 2) the structure of the zooplankton community

changed after the disruption altering the biomass proportions among

zooplankton groups and changing species diversity and richness. 


xmethods

Zooplankton data were from several sources (Table 1). Detailed

sampling methods are described in the source publications and are

only described briefly here. Only data from epilimnetic sampling of

the zooplankton community was used as it was the most frequently

employed method. Monthly (April to October) south-shore data were

derived from the United States Geological Survey and Cornell

University (USGS-Cornell) biomonitoring program during 1987ñ

1991 and 2001ñ2005 (Johannsson et al., 1991; Holeck et al., 2008).

Seasonal (spring, summer, fall) data were also available from the Lake

Ontario Lower Aquatic Food Web Assessment (LOLA) studies

conducted during 2003 (Holeck et al., 2008). Temporally intensive

data collected weekly (April to October) at two stations during 1987ñ

1991 came from the long-term biomonitoring program conducted by

the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO; Johannsson et

al., 1998; Johannsson, 2003). A subset of the temporally intensive DFO

data (1987ñ1991) was selected to create a seasonal data set (spring,

summer, and fall) that matched the same weeks of sampling as the

LOLA 2003 seasonal sampling (Table 1).

The spatial distribution and bathymetric depths of the sampling

sites varied among programs (Fig. 1). The USGS-Cornell biomonitoring

program sampled zooplankton 2 km from the south shore (20 to

26-m bathymetric depth) and 20 km from the south shore (190 to

210-m bathymetric depth) at two locations, one off Oak Orchard,

72 km east of the mouth of the Niagara River, and the other off Smoky

Point, 66 km east of Oak Orchard. The LOLA program had the most

spatially extensive data sets with sampling sites throughout the lake

and station bathymetric depths ranging from 10 to 221-m (Fig. 1).

Using the same methods as the LOLA program, the DFO program

sampled zooplankton at Station 81 (34-m bathymetric depth) in

eastern Lake Ontario and at station 41 (128-m bathymetric depth)

near the center of Lake Ontario (Fig. 1).

Zooplankton species were categorized as small cladocerans

(Bosminidae, Chydoridae, Ceriodaphnia sp., Diaphanosoma sp., Alona

sp.), large cladocerans (Daphnia sp., Leptodora kindtii, Macrothrix

laticornis, Holopedium sp.), invasive predatory cladocerans (Bythotrephes

longimanus, Cercopagis pengoi), calanoid copepods, and

cyclopoid copepods. Proportions of the copepod nauplii were added

to the biomass of adult calanoid and cyclopoid copepods based on the

relative proportions of the adults. Rare harpacticoid copepods were

not included in the analysis. Data were not available to adequately

assess changes in rotifer and dreissenid veliger biomass, so they were

excluded.

Only the USGS-Cornell data set was used for the analysis of species

richness and diversity because sites, seasonal sampling intensity, and

counting and identification methods were identical between time

periods. Copepodites, nauplii, individual Daphnia sp. that could not be

assigned to a specific species, and harpacticoid copepodswere excluded.

The ShannonñWeiner diversity index was calculated using zooplankton

species density as measure of abundance. Species diversity and richness

were compared among time periods, with and without inclusion of the

invasive predatory cladocerans, using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney

U test for independent samples (a=0.05) corrected for multiplecomparisons

using a sequential Bonferroni procedure (Quinn and

Keough, 2003). Zooplankton inhabit water below the epilimnion and were not

captured by the sampling protocols, the extent of which varies with

species group. As the epilimnion seasonally deepens, the percentage of

the totalwater column zooplankton population captured by epilimnetic

sampling increases. In Lake Ontario, metalimnetic production can

account for 10 to 56% of the total annual water column zooplankton

production (Kuns and Sprules, 2000) and needs to be accounted for

when calculating whole-lake production. Data from 1986 and 1987

were used to develop functions to correct the 1987ñ1991 DFO data for

the presence of animals belowour epilimnetic sampling depths. On four occasionsbetweenJuly1andSeptember301986andtwice in July1987,

zooplankton vertical profileswere determined during the day and night

at stations 41 and 81 using a combination of a vertical tow (64-µ mesh,

50-cmdiameter,metered net) through the epilimnion and five discretedepth

samples (41-L ShindlerñPatalas trap, 75-µ sock) through the

metalimnion. The percentage of each species which resided in the

epilimnion was calculated as the areal abundance (no./m2) of that

species in the epilimnion divided by the sumof the areal abundances in

the epilimnion and metalimnion, multiplied by 100. When the

percentages of each species in the epilimnion were examined with

respect to the mixed depth, similar patterns were observed at both

stations, with only Daphnia retrocurva and Diacyclops thomasi undergoing

distinct diurnal vertical migrations. Consequently, all data for each

species were considered in the analyses of these vertical patterns with

the exception of D. retrocurva and D. thomasi where only daytime data

were examined; all DFO samples during 1987ñ1991 were collected

during daylight hours.

The relationship between the percentage in the total epilimnetic and

metalimnetic population captured as a function of sampling depth was

described with the model

log %ﬁ = a + b∑depthﬁ 1ﬁ

where log (%) is the natural log of the percentage of the total

epilimnetic and metalimnetic population found in the epilimnion, a is

a constant and b is the slope, and depth is the depth of the mixed

layer. The model was fit to the data using a generalized linear model

(GLZ, STATISTICA, StatSoft Inc.) using a log linking function and

assuming a Poisson error term (Quinn and Keough, 2003). It was

assumed that the relationship only applied up to a threshold depth,

where it was observed that the percentage captured reached a plateau

and did not vary with depth. Corrections were determined using the

equation for depths less than the threshold depth, and mean

percentage correction was used for depths equal to or greater than

the threshold depth. The threshold depth was determined to the

nearest 0.5-m by visually inspecting plots of the data. The plateau

percentage was estimated as the mean of the observed percent

captured of all observations beyond the plateau depth. Speciesspecific

equations were developed for Ceriodaphnia lacustris, Eubosmina

coregoni, Bosmina longirostris, Daphinia retrocurva, and Diacyclops

thomasi. Data were combined for all small cladoceran species to

develop a general small cladoceran correction function. The correction

function developed for Daphinia retrocurva was applied to all large

cladocerans. Correction functions were developed and applied for all

species combined within other zooplankton groups: cyclopoid

copepods, calanoid copepods, cyclopoid nauplii, and calanoid nauplii.

To estimate zooplankton biomass, species-specific, aerial epilimnetic

densitieswere determined fromthe data in Johannsson et al. (1998) for

the approximatelyweekly samples fromApril to October 1987ñ1991 for

stations 41 and 81. During the stratified period, sample depth and the

species or species-group correction functionswere used to estimate the

animals in the metalimnion. Total density was multiplied by speciesspecific

mean dry weights based on Lake Ontario lengthñweight

relationships and size-frequency distributions for the dominant species

tabulated from published sources (Stockwell and Johannsson, 1997;

Johannsson and O'Gorman, 1991) and unpublished data from the

Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Burlington, Ontario, Canada. Annual production during 1987ñ1991was calculated as the product

of daily zooplankton group biomass and the daily production to biomass

(P/B) ratios summed over a year (April through to the end of March).

Daily P/B ratios were calculated from estimates of the daily isothermal

mixed layer temperature and P/Bñtemperature relationships (Shuter

and Ing, 1997). Daily mixed-layer isothermal temperatures were

estimated from a spatially explicit empirical model (Appendix A).

Daily biomass estimates for each station were determined by

interpolating between sampling events assuming exponential rates of

population biomass change between weeks. Species-specific intrinsic

rates of increase or decrease (r) were estimated as

r =

lnBt + 1ﬁ-lnB0 + 1ﬁ

n

2ﬁ

where B0 is the biomass (mg dry weight∑m-2) at the beginning of the

interpolation interval, Bt is the biomass at the end of the

interpolation interval, and n is the size of the interpolation interval

in days. Daily biomass from October 31 to April 1 the next year was

estimated by assuming an exponential decline in biomass from

October to April. In this case, species-specific intrinsic rates of

population decline (r-values) were determined using the same

formula where B0 was the average October biomass and Bt was the

average April biomass the following year.

The bathymetry of Lake Ontario was described using a 2-km2 grid

system (Robertson and Jordan, 1972) of 4621 spatially referenced

cells with an estimated mean bathymetric depth. Using the spatially

explicit empirical temperature models (Appendix A), temperature of

the mixed layer was estimated as the average temperature from 0 to

5 m for each cell, biweekly for each year (1987ñ1991) from April to

October. The models allowed us to estimate the biweekly average

mixed-layer temperature independently for each of the 4621 cells each year. The year effect on temperature is represented in the model

by the inclusion of biweekly, year-specific, mid-lake temperatures

(Appendix A). For the other months, the average monthly mixed layer

water column temperatures was assigned to each cell based on

average near-surface temperatures measured from 1962 to 2002

(Stewart and Bowlby, 2009). Daily temperatures were estimated by

linear interpolation between biweekly or monthly estimates.

Themixed layer depth is shallower during July in thewest region of

LakeOntario (Stewart and Robertson, 1991) and this spatial patternwas

confirmed for other months (Appendix A; Table A5). It was assumed

therefore that the daily zooplankton group biomass of station 41,which

had coolerwater and shallowthermocline depthswas representative of

western Lake Ontario and the zooplankton group biomass of station 81,

withwarmerwater and deeper thermocline depths, was representative

of eastern Lake Ontario (see Appendix A for delineation of eastern and

western Lake Ontario).

Daily production for each bathymetric cell was estimated as the

product of the daily zooplankton group P/B and the daily biomass (either

station 81 or 41). If the bathymetric depth of a cell was b20-m the areal

estimate of production was reduced proportionately. Whole-lake

zooplankton group and total annual production (g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1)

was the weighted average of production of each cell, using the number of

cells as weights. Relative changes in zooplankton group biomass over time were

assessed by comparing USGS-Cornell data from 1987 to 1991 and 2001

to 2005 (Table 1). These data were collected and processed using the

same protocols (e.g., common counting methods and lengthñweight

curves applied during both time periods). The 2003 LOLA seasonal

epilimnetic zooplankton group biomasses were also compared to a

1987ñ1991 subset of theDFOdata.TheDFOsubset included data only for

stations 81 and 41 with sampling dates chosen to match the sampling

weeks of the LOLA data (Table 1). For this comparison, neither data set

was corrected for animals not sampled below the epilimnion. Unfortunately,

taxon length to weight conversions or means applied to the

1987ñ1991 to estimate biomass from density differed from those used

for the 2003 LOLAdata, so this comparison needs to be qualified.Also, the

DFO sampling during 1987ñ1991 was at only two stations, while the

2003 LOLAsampling included 29 sites throughout the lake (Fig. 1).While

not an ideal comparison, it provides a valuable independent validation of

the general trends detected in the USGS-Cornell comparison.

Changes in zooplankton group biomass between time periods

were assessed using simple means across all years, sites, and seasons.

Like many comparative studies through time, making statistical

inferences is complicated because time-series observations can be

autocorrelated, may not be independent, and depending on the

statistical model may represent pseudoreplication (sensu Hurlbert,

1984). To accommodate this concern, randomization tests (Quinn and

Keough, 2003; Manly, 2007) were used to assess how sampling error

might influence our estimates of time period means of total

zooplankton biomass, zooplankton species-group biomass, and

species group proportion. For both of the USGS-Cornell data bases

all observation were resampled from each time period (all years

combined) within five seasonal strata (April-May, June, JulyñAugust,

September, October) 5000 times with replacement. For each resampling

event, the number of samples drawn from each stratum

matched the original number of observations. All years and sites

were treated as one set of observations and resampled at random. The

mean and the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles derived from the distribution of

samples were calculated for each metric. The same method was

applied to the DFO versus LOLA comparison, except that there were

only three seasonal strata (spring, summer, fall).

The null hypothesis that therewas no difference in total zooplankton

biomass, zooplankton species-group biomass, and species group

proportion between 1987ñ1991 and 2001ñ2005 was tested by first

estimating the original observed difference in the sample means

between the two time periods for both sets of independent comparisons

[USGS-Cornell samples collected during both time periods and the DFO

(1987ñ1991) versus LOLA (2003)].

The difference between the means of each individual resample was

calculated and subtracted the original observed mean. The absolute

value of this differencewas used to derive the randomdistribution to be

expected if the null hypothesis was true (Manly, 2007). These

distributions were used to determine the probability that the absolute

values of the observed difference could have occurred by chance as

measured by the distribution of the 5000 resampled observations. The

null hypothesis was rejected if the probabilities were less than 0.05.

Corrections for multiple-comparisons were done using a sequential

Bonferroni procedure (Quinn and Keough, 2003) among the zooplankton

groups within each set of independent comparison.

The 2003 LOLA data and the 2001ñ2005 USGS-Cornell data were

not collected frequently enough to allow for direct estimates of

production. However, the sampling designs were sufficient to

measure relative changes in biomass. Therefore production was

estimated for these time periods by assuming that changes in

production would be directly proportional to changes in mean

zooplankton group biomass. For example, if a zooplankton group

biomass during 2003 was estimated to be 1/3 the biomass estimated

for the same group during 1987ñ1991, than it was assumed that

production of that zooplankton group during 2003 was 1/3 the

production estimated for the same group during 1987ñ1991. The

proportional change in zooplankton group biomass from 1987 to 1991

was estimated independently for 2003 and 2001ñ2005. For 2003, the

changes in the mean total zooplankton and zooplankton group

biomass from the 2003 LOLA data set were compared to the same

estimates for the 1987ñ1991 DFO data subset (Table 1). For 2001ñ

2005, the changes in the mean total zooplankton and zooplankton

group biomass from the 2001ñ2005 USGS-Cornell data set were

compared to the same estimates for the 1987ñ1991 USGS-Cornell data

set (Table 1). The production of invasive predatory cladocerans was

estimated by multiplying the estimate of large cladoceran production

by the ratio of the mean biomass of invasive predator cladocerans to

the mean biomass of large cladocerans.

This approach assumed that therewas no change in the zooplankton

group P/B ratios fromthose estimated in 1987ñ1991. The assumption of

no temperature induced change in P/B ratios by was evaluated

comparing April to October mid-lake temperatures (Stewart and

Bowlby, 2009) during 1987ñ1991 and 2001ñ2005 using a factorial

analysis of variance with mid-lake temperature as the dependent

variable and month and time period as categorical predictor variables.

xresults An example of the observed percent total population as a function of

depth and the fitted correction function for Eubosmina coregoni (Fig. 2)

is typical of the fitted function for other species and groups (Table 2).

The percentage of Tropocyclops extensus captured was variable and no

pattern was evident; however. we assumed this was due to sampling

error. Therefore the general cyclopoid copepod correction function was

applied to this species as it is a warm water species and likely follows a

pattern similar to the other warm-water groups. Total whole-lake epilimnetic plus metalimnetic mean zooplankton

production during 1987ñ1991 was estimated at 42.43 (g dry wt∑m-2∑

year-1; Table 3). Production was dominated by cyclopoid copepods

(26.00 g drywt∑m-2∑year-1), followed by small cladocerans (9.08 g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1), large cladocerans (6.97 g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1), and

calanoid copepods (0.38 g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1). The magnitude of change in biomass varied by zooplankton group

and between data set comparisons. Total zooplankton biomass

declined in the later time period by a factor of 1.9 to 2.0 compared

to the early time period (Table 4). The analyses indicate that large

cladoceran biomass did not change [USGS-Cornell P=0.031, Sequential

Bonferroni corrected (SBc) a=0.025; DFO versus LOLA data set,

P=0.124; Table 4]. Small cladoceran biomass declined by a factor of

1.86 for the USGS-Cornell comparison (P=0.013, SBc a=0.017;

Table 4), but no change was indicated by the DFO versus LOLA

comparison (P=0.629; Table 4). Calanoid biomass declined by a

factor of 3.9 for the DFO versus LOLA data set (Pb0.001, SBc a=0.008;

Table 4), but there was no significant difference between time periods

in the USGS-Cornell data sets (P=0.726; Table 4). Cyclopoid

copepods were the dominant zooplankton group, and biomass

declined significantly in both data set comparisons by a factor of 3.6

to 5.7 (Pb0.001, SBc a=0.008; Table 4).

The proportion of cyclopoid copepods decreased and invasive

predatory cladocerans increased for both UGSG-Cornell and DFOLOLA

comparison (Pb0.001, SBc a=0.008; Fig. 3). Cyclopoid

copepods declined from an average of 49ñ52% of the biomass to 35ñ

40% while invasive predatory cladocerans increased from a barely

detectable proportion of the biomass (b0.03%, not shown) to an

average of 5 to 8% of the biomass (Fig. 3). The proportions of other

zooplankton groups did not change for the USGS-Cornell comparison

(Fig. 3a), but the DFO-LOLA comparison indicated that the proportion

of calanoid copepods decreased and that the proportion of small and

large cladocerans increased (Pb0.001, SBc a=0.008; Fig. 3b).

Zooplankton species richness including the invasive predatory

cladocerans ranged from 16 to 20 and species diversity ranged from

1.26 to 2.08 (Table 5). There was no significant difference in

zooplankton species richness (P=0.465; invasives included,

P=0.602; invasives excluded) or diversity (P=0.047, SBc

a=0.017; invasives included, P=0.08; invasives excluded; Table 5)

between time periods.

The ANOVA model comparing AprilñOctober mid-lake temperatures

during 1987ñ1991 and 2001ñ2005 indicated no significant

time period effect (P=0.351), validating our assumption of no

temperature related changes in zooplankton group P/B. Changes to

whole-lake annual zooplankton production (Table 3) are based

directly on changes in the ratios of biomass between time periods

(Table 4). Total production declined by approximately half from

42.43 (g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1) during 1987ñ1991 to 21.91 (g dry

wt∑m-2∑year-1) during 2003 or 21.01 (g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1)

during 2001ñ2005 (Table 3). The largest change in production was

estimated for cyclopoid copepods which declined from 26.00 to an

estimated 4.54 during 2003 and an average of 7.24 during 2001ñ

2005 (Table 3). The production of large cladocerans was estimated

to decline slightly in 2003 and during 1987ñ1991 (Table 3).

Estimates of small cladoceran production derived from the changes

in the USGS-Cornell biomass indicate a decline from 9.08 to 4.87 (g

dry wt∑m-2∑year-1) while the DFO and LOLA comparison indicated

virtually no change (Table 3). Calanoid production was estimated to

decline by a factor of 0.38 to 0.09 (g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1) in 2003,

but the USGS-Cornell data set comparison indicated no significant

change in calanoid biomass (Table 4) or production from 1987ñ

1991 to 2001ñ2005 (Table 3). 


xdiscussion
This study compliments and extends earlier assessments of changes

in Lake Ontario zooplankton biomass and production (Kuns and Sprules,

2000; Johannsson, 2003; Holeck et al., 2008). Our production estimates

determined during 1987ñ1991 (95% CI 36ñ49 g dry wt∑m-2∑year-1)

were higher than reported in previous studies. For example, using the

egg-ratio method for Lake Ontario during 1987ñ1991, Johannsson

(2003) estimated that seasonal epilimnetic production (June 15ñ

October 31) ranged from approximately 8ñ19 (g dry wt∑m-2).

Expansion of estimates to the entire year and the addition of speciesspecific

estimates of metalimnetic production would result in higher

estimates. Our application of daily spatially-explicit P/B ratiosmay be an

improvement over the egg-ratiomethod applied by Johannsson (2003).

The egg-ratio method only estimates growth after eggs are produced

and can be influenced by the assumed timing of these events. The P/B

ratio method estimates the growth of the population throughout the

year. Kuns and Sprules (2000), using a combination of egg ratio and

daily P/B ratio methods, estimated that epilimnetic plus metalimnetic production (May to October) for Lake Ontario during 1993 and 1994

ranged from18.9 to 23.8 (g dry∑m-2); assuming awet to dry conversion

of 0.1). This is closer in magnitude to our annual estimates determined

for 2001ñ2005 (20.2 to 22.7 g dry∑m-2∑year-1). This does not mean

that zooplankton production had declined lakewide between 1987ñ

1991 and 1993ñ1994; no downward trend in epilimnetic zooplankton

production was observed in the main lake (station 41) between 1987

and 1995 (Johannsson, 2003). Declines started in the Kingston Basin

(station 81) in 1994; however, production of dreissenid veliger larvae

made up the difference in 1995óthey were not enumerated in 1994

(Johannsson, 2003). Significantly, phytoplankton biomass also did not

decline at either station in the 1987ñ1995 period (Johannsson et al.,

1998). Our determinations of higher levels of zooplankton production

than previously estimated are most likely due to the addition of

metalimnetic production and expansion to the whole year. However,

the difference could also be related to our application of spatially explicit

P/B ratios versus the more commonly applied non-spatial P/B ratios or

egg-ratio methods. Rand et al. (1995) estimated that alewife predatory

demand on zooplankton exceeded estimates of zooplankton production

during 1991. Our updated zooplankton production estimates may

contribute to solving this paradox.

The absence of any change in zooplankton species richness and

diversity coincident with the establishment of the invasive predator

cladocerans in Lake Ontario by 2001ñ2005 may indicate that the Lake

Ontario zooplankton community is more resilient to food web effects

from invasive disruption compared to inland lakes (Strecker et al.,

2006) or other Great Lakes. This may be due to the suppression of the

invasive predatory cladocerans by alewife predation. It may also be

related to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in zooplankton

community composition. The variability in the composition of alewife

diets across space and season in Lake Michigan and Lake Ontario is

immense (Stewart et al., 2009; Pothoven and Vanderploeg, 2004),

suggesting that alewife are exploiting a zooplankton community

highly variable in species composition over space and time.

Heterogeneity increases invasibility, reduces the impact of invaders,

and increases coexistences of native and invading species (Melbourne

et al., 2007). Due to their large size, the Great Lakes have much greater

abiotic and biotic spatial and temporal heterogeneity, which may

serve to mitigate the influence of the invasive predatory cladocerans

and other invasives, especially in comparison to smaller inland lakes.

Zooplankton productivity has rarely been assessed in theGreat Lakes

following the invasion-induced post 1990s ecological change (except cf. Johannsson et al., 2000). This study represents the first direct

comparison of changes in zooplankton production before and after the

invasion-induced disruption and will be important to food web-scale

investigations of invasion effects. Our results confirm the predictions of

a decline in zooplankton productivity following dreissenid invasion and

reducednutrient loadings (Millard et al., 1995; Johannsson, 2003;Hecky

et al., 2004; Holeck et al., 2008). The 2001ñ2005 declines in total

zooplankton group biomass and production observed fromthe analysis

of two independent data sets were similar in magnitude, indicating the

general robustness of our methods. However, the observed shifts in

zooplankton community composition from 1987ñ1991 to 2001ñ2005

were not consistent between the two data set comparisons. The USGSCornell

data set comparisons was considered more reliable as the

sampling included more years, and common methods of counting and

processingwere applied. The inclusion of 5 years of data better accounts

for annual variation in zooplankton community composition. The

community composition characterized by only one year of data for the

LOLA post-invasion period may be unique and not indicative of overall

long-termtrends. Support for this contention is evident in the similarity

between the zooplankton group proportions during 1987ñ1991

between the 5 years of USGS-Cornell data (Fig. 3a) and the 5 years of

DFO data (Fig. 3b), despite the fact that they employed different

temporal and seasonal sampling designs. This suggests thatmonitoring

programs that account for annual variation may be more robust than

periodic spatially extensive sampling programs. Alternatively, the

variation associated with the expanded spatial extent of the 2003

LOLA sampling (Fig. 1)may have resulted in a unique butmore accurate

characterization of the zooplankton community, which can only be

reliably compared to programs of similar spatial extent.

Although we did account for spatial variation in P/B ratios due to

epilimnetic temperature differences, only two sites were used to describe

seasonal and spatial variation in biomass. The analysis may underestimate

the magnitude of spatial variation in zooplankton production if

other factors, such as predation or food resources, were more important

in other regions of the lake. However, temperature has been shown to be

a strong determinant of zooplankton community composition. Patalas

(1969) documented spatial differences in the seasonal development of

Lake Ontario zooplankton community related to temperature. Generally,

crustacean zooplankton appeared first and reached highest densities in

the warmer shallow water of the eastern region, with the difference

between the east and west regions, and nearshore and offshore areas

becoming less prominent as the season progressed. Lake Ontario

temperatures were observed to be persistently warmest nearshore and

in the eastern region and cooler offshore and in the western region

(Patalas, 1969; Stewart and Bowlby, 2009, Appendix A). Seasonal

zooplankton densities were strongly correlated with a site-specific

index of epilimnetic heat content (Patalas, 1969). Zooplankton population

growth is also positively related to temperature (Shuter and Ing,

1997), which leads to the prediction that zooplankton biomass and

production in Lake Ontario should be higher nearshore versus offshore,

and highest in the eastern versus western regions of the lake. Station 81

(34-m bathymetric depth) is in the warmest region of Lake Ontario and

station 41 (128-m bathymetric depth) is in the coolest region, so a

considerable amount of the spatial variation in zooplankton biomasswas

accounted for. Given the high costs associated with monitoring Great

Lake ecosystems,more work is needed to better understand the relative

importance of capturing spatial variation versus annual variation. Such

an analysis could be used to improve the design of future zooplankton

monitoring programs.

Rotifers and dreissenid veligerswere not included in our analysis, but

do contribute to total planktonic production. In Lake Ontario, rotifer

biomass ranged seasonally from 4% to 17% of herbaceous zooplankton

biomass (Johannsson, 2003) and from 1.0% to 12.0% of total zooplankton

biomass, not including Mysis diluviana (Sprules and Munawar, 1991;

Makarewicz et al., 1995). Dreissenid veligersmay have been an important

contributor to zooplankton production during the mid-1990s, especially

in the warmer nearshore areas (Johannsson, 2003). However, by 2003,

lake-wide seasonal zooplankton sampling (Holeck et al., 2008) indicated

that dreissenid veligers comprised only 0.1%, 3.7%, and 1.9% of the total

zooplankton biomass in spring, summer, and fall, respectively (Cornell

University Biological Field Station, Bridgeport, NY, unpublished data).

Johannsson et al. (2000) estimated that Lake Erie dreissenid veligers grew

on average of 0.1 day-1 at temperatures above 10 ∞C and 0.04 day-1

below 10 ∞C. Applying these rates to Lake Ontario seasonal temperatures

would result in an annualized P/B for dreissenid veligers of approximately

25.6. Our average annualized zooplankton group P/Bs derived from this

study were as follows: calanoids (4.6), cyclopoids (21.4), small

cladocerans (29.9), and large cladocerans (27.9). Using the zooplankton

group biomass as weights, the weighted average zooplankton community

P/B was estimated as 22.9. Therefore as a percentage of total

zooplankton production, the contribution from dreissenid veligerswould

be only slightly higher [by a factor of 1.11 (25.6/22.9)] than estimated by

their percent contribution to total zooplankton community biomass and

is estimated at approximating 2.0%.

Lake Ontario phytoplankton biomass has declined (Millard et al.,

2003; Munawar and Munawar, 2003), and as demonstrated by this

study and others, this has been associated with declines in zooplankton

biomass and production (Johannsson et al., 1998; Holeck et al., 2008)

and declines in alewife (O'Gorman et al., 2008). This overall multitrophic

level decline in productivity complicates interpretations of

zooplankton community changes. While interpreting the results of this

study it is important to distinguish declines in overall zooplankton

biomass and production and disproportionate changes in biomass and

production of some zooplankton groups, measured as changed

zooplankton group proportions. Interpretation is further complicated

by inconsistency between the two data set comparisons.

Do declines in Lake Ontario primary production (PP) account for

the observed decline in zooplankton production from 1987ñ1991 to

2001ñ2005? Approximately 80% of the water flowing into Lake

Ontario comes from Lake Erie (http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/atlas), so

we applied Lake Erie post-dreissenid PP:TP ratios (Depew et al., 2006)

to estimates of Lake Ontario TP during 2003 to estimate the PP in

comparison to direct estimates of Lake Ontario PP during 1987ñ1991

(Millard et al., 1996). Lake Erie PP:TP ratios (±1 SD) were 10.7 (2.8)

and 14.3 (3.3) for nearshore (=20-m) and offshore, respectively

(Depew et al., 2006). Using theses ratios and the average seasonal TP

for Lake Ontario during 2003 of 9.6 (µg∑L-1) from Holeck et al. (2008),

annual PP in Lake Ontario during 2003 was estimated to range from

102.7 to 137.4 (g C∑m-2). The same TP value was applied to the PP to

mean seasonal TP relationship developed by Millard et al. (1999),

which excluded sites potentially impacted by dreissenids, and

resulted in an estimated PP of 133.7 (g C∑m-2). Considering that

water b20-m represents only approximately 13% of the total area of

Lake Ontario, it is reasonable to assume that the offshore seasonal PP

of 137.4 was most comparable to the data in Millard et al. (1996).

During 1987ñ1991 Lake Ontario PP averaged 169.9 (Millard et al.,

1996). Compared to our 2003 estimate, PP may have declined to only

80% of its 1987ñ1991 level, while zooplankton productivity declined

by approximately half. This suggests that in addition to PP decline,

some other mechanism is further reducing zooplankton productivity.

It has been hypothesized (Hecky et al., 2004) and partially confirmed

(Depew et al., 2006) that dreissenids shunt nutrients and particulate

organic carbon from the nearshore water column to the benthos,

reducing pelagic PP. This effect would be accounted for in our estimate

of PP and is not likely an explanation for a disproportionate decline in

zooplankton production. Direct dreissenid grazing of phytoplankton,

making it unavailable to support zooplankton production, might be a

mechanism causing the disproportionate decline in zooplankton

production from 1987ñ1991 to 2001ñ2005. Declines in chlorophyll-a

following establishment of dreissenid mussels have been attributed to

dreissenid grazing (Caraco et al., 1997, 2006). Grazing by dreissenids

mussels was estimated to remove 26% of the available primary production in western Lake Erie (Madenjian, 1995), which would thus

be unavailable to support zooplankton production. Also, selective

feeding by dreissenid mussels has been implicated in a shift in the

phytoplankton community to increased prevalence of blue-green algae

and other large colonial formsof algae (Makarewicz et al., 1999;Nicholls

et al., 2002; Bierman et al., 2005;Miller andWatzin, 2007; Naddafi et al.,

2007) which may be less edible to zooplankton (Porter, 1973; Lehman

and Sandgren, 1985). A reduction in the yield of chlorophyll-a from a

given concentration of total phosphorus (TP) has been attributed to

dreissenid filtering in nearshore Lake Ontario (Nicholls et al., 1999;

Millard et al., 1999). However, dreissenid filtering impacts are less likely

in the offshore of deep thermally stratified Lake Ontario, where very

little of the epilimnetic water is in proximity to dreissenid mussel beds.

For Lake Ontario, less than 10% of the total volume of epilimnetic water

(b=20-m) is in the nearshore zone over bathymetric depths b=20-m,

where it could presumably be subject to mussel filtering effects. If not

dreissenid filtering, changes in the depth distribution, growth, or

behavior of zooplankton due to the invasive predatory cladocerans

(Pangle et al., 2007) could have contributed to reduced zooplankton

productivity beyond that predicted by changes in primary productivity.

Is overgrazing of zooplankton by predators contributing to overall

declines in zooplankton production? Correlative studies clearly implicate

predation by the invasive predatory cladocerans, especially

Cercopagis (Benoit et al., 2002; Laxon et al., 2003;Warner et al., 2006).

However, alewife and the invasive predatory cladocerans both consume

common zooplankton prey and their potential predation effects cannot

be considered in isolation (Stewart et al., 2009). Overgrazing by alewife

may be a more likely mechanism. Lake Ontario is often characterized as

having an undersupply of zooplankton production. It has been

estimated that consumption by either alewife (Rand et al., 1995) or

Cercopagis (Laxon et al., 2003) can exceed the production of their

zooplankton prey. This implies intense predation pressure. Production

of short-lived zooplankton species may respond quickly to declines in

PP, resulting in a tight coupling between the production of small

zooplankton and larger predatory zooplankton. In contrast, there may

be lag of several years before the production of longer-lived multi-age

class population of zooplanktivorous alewife declines in response to

declines in PP. This would result in an uncoupling of the predator

demand for zooplankton by alewife with the ability of the system to

produce the required supply of zooplankton production, resulting in

overgrazing. It is worth investigating if this is a general phenomena

associated system characterized by intense predation pressure on

zooplankton from prey fish and declining primary productivity.

Predation by both alewife and invasive predatory cladocerans may

be the mechanism causing a disproportionate decline in cyclopoids.

Cyclopoid copepods often dominate the zooplankton portion of alewife

diets and are consumed by alewife during all seasons (Stewart et al.,

2009). Cyclopoid copepods are also important in the diets in the early

life-history stages ofmany other LakeOntario fish including lake herring

(Coregonus artedii), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and

rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax; Davis and Todd, 1998; Freeberg et

al., 1990; Urban and Brandt, 1993; Lantry and Stewart, 1993), and

alewife (Norden, 1967;Heinrich, 1981; Urban and Brandt, 1993; Hewett

and Stewart, 1989; Lantry and Stewart, 1993). Cercopagis predation on

cyclopoids is seasonal, with highest predation occurring primarily

during mid-summer peak in abundance (Laxon et al., 2003). Reduced

availability of zooplankton for alewife was suggested by extremely low

stomach content weights at bathymetric depths b70-m following the

disruptive changes of the 1990s (Stewart et al., 2009). This is consistent

with overgrazing of zooplankton in nearshore waters by alewife and a

switch to offshore food resources evidenced by increased offshore

distribution of alewife (O'Gorman et al., 2000) and increased prevalence

of Mysis diluviana in alewife diets (Stewart et al., 2009). These

observations suggest that grazing pressure on zooplankton may have

increased to the point whereby alewife needed to change their

distribution to acquire enough food.

The disproportionate decline in cyclopoid biomass in both data

sets was consistent with the predicted predation effect by alewife and

invasive predatory cladocerans (Laxon et al., 2003; Warner et al.,

2006; Stewart et al., 2009), but a reduction in the proportion of small

cladocerans that could be predicted from the same studies was not

detected. The USGS-Cornell data set comparisons did detect a decline

in small cladoceran biomass, but this was in proportion to the overall

decline in zooplankton biomass, and the proportion of small

cladocerans did not change. On the other hand, the DFO and LOLA

data set comparison saw no change in small cladoceran biomass and

detected a significant increase in the proportion of small cladocerans.

As discussed above, the DFO and LOLA data set comparison may be

less robust due to differences in processing methodology, trying to

compare multi-year spatially limited sampling program to a singleyear

spatially extensive sampling, and reduced seasonal coverage.

In an independent study, Laxon et al. (2003) observed a significant

decline in both cyclopoids and small cladocerans from a comparison of

data from 1986 to 1991 with data from 1999 to 2001. This is consistent

with a general decline in zooplankton productivity, and is consistent

with the observation fromtheUSGS-Cornell comparison.Unfortunately,

Laxon et al. (2003) did not report changes in total zooplankton

community structure so it is not possible to assess changes in

zooplankton group proportions from their study. The Laxon et al.

(2003) study and USGS-Cornell comparison did detect a significant

decline in the biomass of small cladocerans. However, both sampling

programs occurred on the south shore of Lake Ontario and may be

characterizing a regional rather than a lake-wide response. Regional

variation in Lake Ontario temperature (Appendix A, Stewart and

Bowlby, 2009) will influence zooplankton community composition

and seasonal succession (Patalas, 1969) resulting in different zooplankton

community structures and potentially different predator-prey

interactions in different regions of lake during the same calendar

seasons. This temperature-induced variability might bemore problematic

formeasuring cladoceran biomass and detecting change as they are

only abundant after thermal stratificationwhile cyclopoid copepods are

abundant throughout the year (Johannsson et al., 1998). For example,

the inclusion ofwarmer nearshore sites in a spatially extensive sampling

in the spring might elevate estimates of cladoceran biomass in

comparison to less spatially extensive sampling. Theweight of evidence

supports a post-invasion decline in total zooplankton biomass and

production with a disproportionate decline in cyclopoid copepods and

an increase in invasive predatory cladocerans. Evidence for both

absolute and proportionate changes in the biomass and production of

other zooplankton groups is inconclusive.

The ubiquitous consumption of cyclopoids by alewife and other fish

species, and additional summer consumption by the invasive predatory

cladocerans, seems a likely mechanism for their disproportionate

decline. However, better understanding of the interplay among the

effects of various sources of predation (top-down) and reduced

production (bottom-up) effects on zooplankton community structure,

biomass, and production will require a more comprehensive food web

analysis.

Cyclopoid abundance has been shown to be an important determinant

of recruitment in marine fish (Castonguay et al., 2008), and a

similar mechanism may be operating in the Great Lakes. The potential

link between Great Lakes fish recruitment and cyclopoid abundance

warrants further investigation. Also, cyclopoid copepods are the

dominant zooplankton group, and their decline may portend important

changes in the pathway of energy flowand trophic transfer efficiencies.
