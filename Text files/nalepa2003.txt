xabstract
Trends in benthic macroinvertebrate populations were examined in inner and outer Saginaw
Bay, Lake Huron, from 1987 to 1996. These years represent the time period after phosphorus abatement,
but immediately before (1987 to 1990) and after (1991 to 1996) colonization of the bay by the zebra
mussel, Dreissena polymorpha. In 1987 to 1990, densities of the major macroinvertebrate groups in the
inner and outer bay were not significantly different from, or were greater than, densities reported just
prior to abatement efforts in the early 1970s. Oligochaete densities in the deepwater/silt region of the
inner bay were trending downward between 1988 and 1991, but pollution-tolerant forms dominated the
community, indicating the system was eutrophic just prior to Dreissena colonization. Dreissena impacts
on the macroinvertebrate community varied depending on the particular habitat. At shallow-water/sand
sites in the inner bay, Gammarus increased, and sphaeriids declined after Dreissena colonization, but no
changes were observed in oligochaetes and chironomids, and overall species diversity showed little
change. At deepwater/silt sites in the inner bay, densities of oligochaetes and chironomids declined just
after the peak in Dreissena, but then returned to levels generally similar to those found prior to
Dreissena. The oligochaete trophic index at deepwater/silt sites indicated a shift from eutrophic to more
oligotrophic indicator species after Dreissena became established, and species diversity increased. In the
outer bay, Diporeia and sphaeriids declined after Dreissena peaked, but few other changes were
observed. Total non-dreissenid macroinvertebrate biomass (AFDW) in the inner bay, and in shallow
areas of the outer bay, did not change as a result of Dreissena colonization. On the other hand, biomass
in the deeper regions of the outer bay decreased because of the loss of Diporeia. Changes in the inner
and outer bay typify the growing dichotomy between nearshore and offshore communities in the Great
Lakes since Dreissena became established. 

xintroduction
Prior to the introduction of the dreissenid mussels
Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis
(zebra mussel and quagga mussel), broad-scale
trends in benthic macroinvertebrate communities in
nearshore areas of the Great Lakes (< 30 m, shallow
bays and basins) were mainly attributed to changes
in nutrient loads. Increased inputs of phosphorus up
until the mid-1970s led to increased densities of
benthic taxa that were tolerant of eutrophic-polluted
conditions, while densities of less-tolerant taxa declined
(see Cook and Johnson 1974 for review).
After phosphorus abatement programs in the mid-
1970s, abundances generally declined, and communities
in many nearshore areas shifted back to taxa
more indicative of an improved trophic state (Johnson
and McNeil 1986, Kreiger and Ross 1993,
Schloesser et al. 1995, Kilgour et al. 2000).
The introduction and proliferation of dreissenid
mussels has complicated the interpretation of benthic
community trends relative to changes in nutrient
loads and system productivity. Because of large
standing stocks and high filtering rates, dreissenids
have altered normal pathways of energy flow from
pelagic to benthic regions (Nalepa and Fahnenstiel
1995), or have physically altered benthic habitats
(Bially and MacIsaac 2000). Impacts on the
macroinvertebrate community have varied depending
upon particular habitat, spatial proximity to
mussel colonies, and taxa initially present. In
nearshore, hard-substrate regions, abundances of
many taxa have increased in response to the increase
in habitat complexity created by mussel
colonies, and/or to the increase in food availability
from mussel biodeposits (Wisenden and Bailey
1995, Botts et al. 1996, Howell et al. 1996, Ricciardi
et al. 1997). In deeper, offshore regions, the response
has generally led to a decline in abundances,
likely because mussels in nearshore areas sequester
food resources that normally would settle in depositional
zones (Nalepa et al. 1998, Lozano et al.
2001). Other studies have shown no change in benthic
standing stocks after Dreissena colonization
(Johannsson et al. 2000), or the positive response
for many taxa was short term, even in hard-substrate,
nearshore regions (Haynes et al. 1999).
In this paper, we document trends in benthic
macroinvertebrate populations in Saginaw Bay,
Lake Huron between 1987 and 1996, and these
trends are examined relative to both phosphorus
abatement and the establishment of Dreissena.
When the sampling surveys were initiated in 1987
and 1988, the objective was to determine if the benthic
community in the bay had responded to improvements
in water quality that resulted from
reductions in phosphorus loads (Bierman et al.
1984). Sampling was designed to assess changes
since the early 1970s, which was the time period
just before abatement efforts. When Dreissena became
established in Lake St. Clair and rapidly
spread through Lake Erie in 1988, it was reasoned
that this species would soon become very abundant
in Saginaw Bay, and further benthic sampling was
initiated in 1990 and continued through 1996 with
the objective of assessing changes induced by
Dreissena. Dreissena did become established in the
bay in 1991 (Nalepa et al. 1995), and thus the 1987
to 1996 sampling period represents the years immediately
before and after dreissenid colonization.

xmethods
Dates, Locations, and Procedures
Samples for benthic macroinvertebrates were collected
at 30 sites in 1987 and 1988, and at 10 sites
in 1990 to 1996 (Fig. 1). Samples were collected in
spring (May), summer (July), and fall (Sept. to
Nov.) of each year except in 1996 when samples
were collected only in summer and fall. Because of
poor weather or mechanical failures, not all sites
were sampled on some dates. Site locations and
sampling dates are given in Nalepa et al. (2002).
Sampling sites were selected by first plotting site
locations of previous benthic surveys (Surber 1954,
1955; Schneider et al. 1969; Batchelder 1973; Great
Lakes Research Division, University of Michigan,
unpublished data), and then choosing the sites to resample
based on type of sampler used, detail of
data provided, and spatial coverage of the bay.
Triplicate samples were collected at each site
with a Ponar grab (area = 0.046 m2). After collection,
each sample was washed into a large tub, and
then into an elutriation device fitted with a sleeve
made of 0.5-mm mesh Nitex (Nalepa et al. 1985).
Retained material was washed into a collection jar
and preserved in 5% buffered formalin containing
rose bengal stain. The substrate was visually described
prior to rinsing the sample through the
Nitex screen (Nalepa et al. 1985).
To obtain quantitative estimates of Dreissena,
samples were collected at eight sites using SCUBA
divers every fall from 1991 to 1996 (Fig. 1). Five
sites were located in areas with sand/cobble and
could not be effectively sampled with the Ponar
(Stations 5, 6, 15, 19, 27), while three sites had
sand substrates and were sampled by both SCUBA
and Ponar (Stations 13, 14, 16). At each site, divers
randomly placed a 0.25 or 0.5 m2 frame on the bottom
and hand-collected all hard material within the
frame area. After all material was removed, the area
within the frame was re-sampled using a diveroperated
suction device fitted with a Nitex net with
0.5-mm openings (Winnell and Jude 1987). This
procedure ensured that all loose mussels were included
in the sample. Triplicate samples were collected
at each site, with divers moving 2 to 3 m
between replicates.
In the laboratory, material collected in the grab
and retained by the 0.5-mm sleeve was placed into
a white enamel pan and organisms were removed,
enumerated, and sorted into major groups (Amphipoda,
Oligochaeta, Sphaeriidae, Chironomidae,
Dreissena, and others) under a 1.5× lighted magnifier
lamp. Turbellarians and nematodes were observed
in the samples but, since methods were not
quantitative for these groups, their numbers were
not recorded. When the number of organisms in a
sample was extremely large, the sample was proportionately
split and only a portion was processed.
All organisms were identified to the lowest practical
taxonomic level. For oligochaetes, between 75
and 100 individuals in a replicate (proportionately
split with a Folsom plankton splitter when numbers
were high) were cleared in lactophenol before identification.
Oligochaetes were mounted on microscope
slides (in glycerine) and their images were
projected onto a sheet of paper using a camera lucida
and then traced. Individuals were identified,
and taxonomic designations placed alongside the
respective traced image. Only individuals with a
prostomium were identified and tabulated; fragments
(without prostomium) were identified as such
but were not counted. For chironomids, a maximum
of 50 individuals were identified per replicate.
Head capsules were teased off the body, cleared in
lactophenol, and mounted on microscope slides
with mentum side up. The corresponding body was
mounted alongside the head capsule and the image
traced as for oligochaetes.
Biomass (ash-free dry weight [AFDW]) for Amphipoda,
Isopoda, Ephemeroptera, Oligochaeta,
Chironomidae, and Dreissena were derived from
length-weight relationships determined either directly
on fresh animals, or taken from the literature.
If a length-weight relationship for a given taxon
was not available from the literature, it was assigned
the relationship of a closely-related form
(Nalepa et al. 2002). When length-weight relationships
were available for only dry weight, ash-free
dry weight was assumed to be 90% of dry weight
(Johnson and Brinkhurst 1971). Weights were determined
by placing fresh animals into pre-weighted,
aluminum planchets, dried at 60°C for 48 h, and
weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg. AFDW was obtained
by re-weighing the specimens after ashing at
550°C for 1 h. Lengths were measured directly or
determined from traced images using a digitizer
(Quigley and Lang 1989).
For oligochaetes, all body fragments present on
the slides were measured and included in the biomass
total. Length-weight conversions are based on
the finding that preservation does not alter length
(Erman and Erman 1975). For Dreissena, lengths
were measured on up to 500 animals in each sample
using a computer scanner and fitted software. If
more individuals were present in the sample, the
sample was proportionately split. To determine
length-weight of Dreissena, at least 25 individuals
of various sizes were collected in fall at Station 5 in
1991 to 1996, and at Station 19 in 1994 to 1996.
Annual biomass is best derived from a lengthweight
determined in the fall when spawning has
been completed (Nalepa et al. 1993). Shell lengths
were measured, and AFDW of the soft tissue was
determined as above. Corresponding length-weight
relationships were determined and then used to calculate
soft-tissue biomass of mussels at the various
sites. In 1991 to 1993, length-weight relationships
derived from mussels collected at Station 5 were
used to calculate biomass at all sites, but in 1994 to
1996 separate relationships derived from mussels at
Station 5 and Station 19 were used to calculate biomass
at sites in the inner bay and outer bay, respectively.

AFDW of other benthic taxa (Sphaeriidae, Gastropoda,
Trichoptera, Isopoda, Hirudinea, and
Diptera other than Chironomidae) was determined
directly from preserved specimens within a given
sample. While preservation does not cause weight
loss in Sphaeriidae (Johnson and Brinkhurst 1971),
weight loss likely occurred in the other taxa. However,
these taxa generally constituted only a small
portion of total biomass at a given site. Further details
of biomass determinations, including lengthweight
regressions, are given in Nalepa et al.
(2002). Site Groupings and Analysis
To examine benthic responses to abatement efforts,
data collected in 1987 to 1990 (post abatement
and pre-Dreissena) were compared to data
from two surveys conducted in the early 1970s (preabatement).
One survey occurred mainly in the
inner bay (in 1971; Batchelder 1973), and the other
occurred in the outer bay (in 1972; Great Lakes Research
Division [GLRD], University of Michigan,
unpublished data). Sampling methods in both surveys
were similar to that of this study; that is, the
collection device was the Ponar grab, and samples
were washed through a 500–600-µm screen. We
matched our sites with sites sampled in 1971 based
on substrate, water depth, and general location,
while our site locations matched 1972 site locations
exactly since the 1972 coordinates were incorporated
into the original sampling design. When testing
for differences between the two time periods
within a given substrate, each site pairing was considered
a separate replicate.
Substrates at the twenty-one sites sampled with
the Ponar grab in the inner bay varied from coarse
sand/gravel to silt, and water depths ranged from
3.0 to 11.8 m (Nalepa et al. 2002). As found by others
(Wood 1964, Robbins 1981), the amount of finegrained
material increased with water depth. For
purposes of data analysis, sites in the inner bay
were grouped into three categories based on water
depth and substrate type: 1) sand/gravel, 3.0 to
4.8 m; 2) silty sand, 4.2 to 9.0 m; and 3) silt, 6.7 to
11.8 m (Table 1). The only site that did not fit into
one of these categories was Station 31. Water depth
at this site was only 3.2 m, but the substrate differed
from all other sites, consisting of coarse plant
debris/silt. This site was located in the center of a
shallow, confined embayment (Wildfowl Bay) andwas not representative of the bay in general. With
this exception, sites in these three categories were
located in regions considered to be non-depositional,
transitional, and depositional, respectively
(Robbins 1981). In the outer bay, substrates consisted
of silty sand at all sites, and depths ranged
from 10 to 30 m (Nalepa et al. 2002). Since substrates
were generally the same, the nine outer bay
sites were grouped into three categories based on
water depth: 10 to 13 m, 16 to 22 m, and 28 to
30 m (Table 1). These depth categories are consistent
with prior characterization of depth-macroinvertebrate
associations in other regions of the Great
Lakes for similar depths and substrate types (Cook
and Johnson 1974, Mozley and Howmiller 1977).
As noted, only ten sites were sampled in 1990 to
1996, but these sites were considered to be representative
of the various habitat types. In the inner
bay, three sites were in the shallow water/sand region
(Stations 13, 14, 16), one site was in the middepth/silty
sand region (Station 11), and three sites
were in the deep water/silt region (Stations 4, 7, and
10) (Fig. 1). In the outer bay, sampling was continued
at three sites, each within the three depth intervals:
13 m (Station 24), 16 m (Station 20), and 28
m (Station 23).
When testing for benthic macroinvertebrate responses
to Dreissena colonization, the 1987 to 1990
period was considered as the pre-Dreissena period,
and 1993 to 1996 was considered as the post-Dreissena
period. While data collected in 1991 and 1992
were included when interpreting trends, these 2
years were considered transitional and not included
in the statistical analysis. That is, Dreissena was
present for only part of the year in 1991, and abundances
were at unsustainably high levels in 1992
(Nalepa et al. 1995). Only data collected at the ten
sites sampled every year were used to assess Dreissena
impacts. The mean of each year was considered
an individual replicate, and differences
between periods were tested using a t-test. Abundance
data were ln +1 transformed prior to any
statistical analysis (t-tests and ANOVAs) and met
the requirements of normality and equality of
variances.
Species composition of the oligochaete community
is a good indicator of trophic status, and community
changes were examined using an
oligochaete trophic index (Howmiller and Scott
1977, Milbrink 1983, Lauritsen et al. 1985). The
index is determined by placing each species (excluding
Naididae and Enchytraeidae) into one of
four categories based on its tolerance to organic enrichment.
Values of each category range from 0 (intolerant
of enrichment; found mostly in oligotrophic
conditions) to 3 (tolerant of enrichment;
found in highly eutrophic conditions). The assigned
category of each species follows that of Milbrink
(1983) and Lauritsen et al. (1985). To obtain the
index, the number of individuals in each category is
multiplied by the category value (species in category
0 are assigned a value of 0.5). The products
are then summed and divided by the total number
of individuals.
The Simpson Diversity Index (Simpson 1949)
and the Bray Curtis Index (Bray and Curtis 1957)
were used to determine changes in structure of the
entire macroinvertebrate community. The former
index considers both taxonomic richness and evenness,
while the latter considers presence/absence
and absolute abundance of each taxa. Of the many
similarity indices, the Bray-Curtis Index has been
shown to be the most effective quantitative index
when assessing changes in community structure
(Hruby 1987, Pontasch and Brusven 1988, Pontasch
et al. 1989). Since the index is sensitive to occasional
large numbers, data were square-root transformed
prior to index calculation (Pontasch and
Brusven 1988). Both indices were determined on
the non-dreissenid community. 

xresults
General Distribution Patterns in 1987 and 1988
Since 30 sites were sampled in 1987 and 1988
and these sites provided broad spatial coverage of
the bay, data collected in these 2 years were used to
characterize general distribution patterns. Total
mean densities in the inner bay generally increased
with water depth and the amount of fine-grained
material (Table 1, Fig. 2). Mean densities at sites
with sand, silty sand, and silt substrates were 1,441,
8,327, and 21,951/m2, respectively. Differences
were significant for all major macroinvertebrate
groups (ANOVA, P < 0.01) (Table 1). Oligochaetes,
chironomids, and sphaeriids were more abundant at
sites with sandy silt or silt substrate, while the amphipod
Gammarus sp. was most abundant at sites
with sand. In terms of composition, oligochaetes
were the dominant group in all three substrates, accounting
for 77 to 95% of all organisms collected.
Dominant species in silt were Limnodrilus
hoffmeisteri and Limnodrilus cervix, while the naidids
Piguetiella michiganensis, Uncinais uncinata,
and Arcteonais lomondi were the most common
species in sand. Most abundant chironomid specieswere Cladotanytarsus spp. and Tanytarsus sp. in
sand, Chironomus anthracinus, Tanytarsus sp., and
Procladius sp. in silty sand, and Chironomus semireductus-gr.
and C. anthracinus in silt.
In the outer bay, total density declined, and the
community shifted to species more typical of a
cold-water environment as depth increased. The
greatest depth-related change occurred in chironomids
(Table 1). Chironomid densities declined from
4,559/m2 at the 10 to 13 m interval to 191/m2 at the
28 to 30 m interval (P < 0.01). Tanytarsus sp.,
Paratendipes sp., and C. anthracinus were the dominant
taxa at the shallower sites, while Heterotrissocladius
spp. was dominant at the deeper sites. The
amphipod Diporeia spp. was most abundant at the
deepest interval (P < 0.01). Both Heterotrissocladius
and Diporeia are typically found in the colder,
deeper regions of the Great Lakes; both species
were rarely found in the inner bay. Total densities
of both oligochaetes and sphaeriids were not related
to depth (P > 0.05). At least for the former group,
this was partly attributable to high densities at one
of the sites in the deepest interval, Station 50. Mean
oligochaete density at this site was 4,100/m2, compared
to just 430/m2 at the other site within this interval,
Station 23. This difference could be
attributed to high numbers of tubificids at Station
50 (82% of all oligochaetes), of which Potamothrix
vejdovskyi and L. hoffmeisteri were the dominant
species. Based on typical exchange rates and flow
patterns from the inner bay to the outer bay (Danek
and Saylor 1977), the community at Station 50 was
more likely influenced by nutrient-rich waters from
the inner bay than the community at Station 23.
Both chlorophyll and total suspended matter was
consistently higher at the former station compared
to the latter (Nalepa et al. 1996). Both P. vejdovskyi
and L. hoffmeisteri do well in enriched environments
(Milbrink 1983). In contrast, the dominant
oligochaete species at Stations 23 was Stylodrilus
heringinaus, an oligotrophic, cold-water form.
Comparisons Pre- and
Post-Phosphorus Abatement
A total of twelve sites sampled in the inner bay in
1987 to 1990 (post abatement) were matched with
sites sampled in 1971 by Batchelder (1973) (preabatement).
Comparisons of the major benthic
groups indicated that mean densities in 1987 to
1990 were generally similar to, or greater than, densities
in 1971 (Table 2). In terms of species composition,
only the chironomid community could be
compared since oligochaetes were not identified to
species in 1971. Further, only broad, generic comparison
of the chironomid community was possible
because of uncertainties with nomenclature and
level of taxonomic detail given for the 1971 data.
Dominant chironomid taxa in 1971 were Tanytarsus
sp. (50%) and Polypedilum spp. (31%) in sand,
Chironomus spp. (41%) and Procladius spp. (34%)
in silty sand, and Chironomus spp. (93%) in silt
(Batchelder 1973). For the same sites, dominant
species in 1987 to 1990 were Cladotanytarus spp.
(25%) and Tanytarsus sp. (23%) in sand, Chironomus
spp. (47%), Tanytarsus sp. (30%) and Procladius
sp. (12%) in silty sand, and Chironomus spp.
(95%) in silt.
In the outer bay, five of the sites sampled in
1987 to 1990 corresponded to sites that were sampled
in 1972 (Table 3). A comparison of densities
in the two sampling periods indicated that all
differences in the major groups were non significant (paired t-test, P > 0.05). Further, the
oligochaete trophic index indicated the community
was dominated by oligotrophic species in both time
periods. Index values (mean ± SE) were 0.96 ±
0.05 in 1972 and 1.02 ± 0.02 in 1987–90. Dominant
species were Spirosperma ferox, Aulodrilus
pluriseta, and S. heringianus; these three species
accounted for 92% of all oligochaetes in 1972 and
65% in 1987 to 1990. Other abundant species in the
latter period were P. vejdovskyi (10%), L. hofmeisteri
(6%), and Aulodrilus americanus (3%). For
chironomids, Tanytarsus sp. was the dominant
species in both periods (45% of all chironomids).
Differences in Simpson’s Diversity Index between
the two periods were non-significant (paired t-test,
P > 0.05).
Trends and Comparisons, Pre- and Post-Dreissena
Dreissena was initially found in samples from
spring 1991, and the first large recruitment occurred
that summer (Nalepa et al. 1995). Mean densities
on cobble/sand in the inner bay, as sampled by
divers, reached a maximum of 33,838/m2 in 1992,
declined in 1993, and then varied between 2,100
and 5,500/m2 from 1993 to 1996 (Table 4). Few
mussels were found at sites with silty sand or silt
substrate during the entire sampling period. Densities
tended to be higher in the outer bay than in the
inner bay, but this was likely a result of greater
amounts of hard substrate (cobble, bedrock) found
at the outer bay sites. Mean biomass for 1993 to
1996 varied between 4.1 and 13.4 g/m2 in the inner
bay, and between 13.8 and 97.8 g/m2 in the outer
bay (Table 4). Greater biomass occurred at sites inthe outer bay not only because of higher densities,
but also because the mussels were larger and
weighed more per unit length (Nalepa et al. 2002).
While mussel densities in the outer bay were generally
consistent between 1994 and 1996, biomass increased
as a result of an increase in mean size
(Nalepa unpublished data).
The response of the benthic community to Dreissena
colonization varied depending upon substrate
type and water depth. At shallower sites with sand
or silty sand substrates in the inner bay, densities of
only two taxa changed significantly relative to the
establishment of Dreissena (Table 5). At these sites,
densities of Gammarus were significantly higher (P
< 0.05), and densities of sphaeriids were significantly
lower (P < 0.05) in the post-Dreissena period
(1993 to 1996) compared to the pre-Dreissena period
(1987 to 1990). Densities of both oligochaetes
and chironomids were not significantly different between
the two periods (P > 0.05). Mean annual densities
of both groups were highly variable at the site
with silty sand (Station 11) in the pre-Dreissena period,
which may explain the lack of statistical significance
between the pre-and post-Dreissena
periods (Table 5). But even so, densities of both
groups were relatively stable between 1991 and
1996 and unaffected by the peak and decline in
Dreissena over that time period. Since oligochaetes
and chironomids, as well as Gammarus, are consistently
more abundant in mussel clusters than in surrounding
substrates (Karatayev et al. 1997), the
relationship between densities of these groups andDreissena was examined by using correlation
analysis. Only those replicate samples taken in the
post-Dreissena period (1993 to 1996) and with
Dreissena present were used in the analysis. Pearson
correlation coefficients between densities of
oligochaetes and chironomids and Dreissena were
not significant (P > 0.05; oligochaete coefficient =
0.13, n = 96; chironomid coefficient = –0.05, n =
96). In contrast, a similar analysis for Gammarus,
was highly significant (P < 0.01; coefficient = 0.61;
n = 62).
Species composition of both oligochaetes and
chironomids were generally unaffected by Dreissena
at sites with sand and silty sand substrates.
The oligochaete trophic index remained generally
constant over the entire sampling period at sites
with both substrates (Fig. 3a). The index does not
include Naididae, however, and this family dominated
the oligochaete community at sites with sand.
A further examination of naidids indicated some
changes in the relative proportion of individual
species, although the total number of taxa was similar
in the pre-and post-Dreissena periods (7 and 10,
respectively). The proportion of the following
species changed the most between the two periods:
Arcteonais lomondi and Chaetogaster sp. decreased
(14.0% to 1.2%; 13.6% to 0.1%) and Piguetiella
michiganensis increased (40.2% to 70.0%). For chironomids,
a total of 19 and 24 taxa were collected
in the pre- and post-Dreissena periods, respectively,
and the dominant species was Cladotanytarsus
mancus in both periods (42.8% and 69.1%). Temporal
trends in Simpson’s Diversity Index relative
to Dreissena colonization were not apparent (Fig.
3b).
At sites in the deepwater/silt region, oligochaete
densities were significantly lower (P < 0.01) in the
post-Dreissena period compared to the pre-Dreissena
period, but differences in the other groups
were not apparent (P > 0.05). Oligochaetes declined
from a peak of 21,195/m2 in 1988 to a low of
1,208/m2 in 1994, and then increased to 4,618/m2
by 1996. Greatest proportional declines occurred
between 1990 and 1991 (50%), and between 1992
and 1993 (76%). While the latter decline followed
the Dreissena peak, it seems unlikely that the former
decline could be attributed entirely to Dreissena.
Mean oligochaete density was 17,749/m2 in
fall 1990, but only 7,758/m2 in spring 1991. Thus,
oligochaete densities were already much lower in
spring 1991 even before the major Dreissena colonization
occurred in summer 1991.
Tubificid oligochaetes comprised 99% and 90%
of all oligochaetes in the pre- and post-Dreissena
periods, respectively, at sites in the deepwater/silt
region, and the oligochaete trophic index indicated
a distinct shift from eutrophic to mesotrophic
species after Dreissena colonization (Fig. 3a). The
mean index value declined from 2.14 ± 0.12 to 1.72
± 0.09 (P < 0.05). The proportion of the following
species indicative of considerable enrichment decreased:
L. hoffmeisteri (33.4% to 22.2%), L. cervix
(25.8% to 8.7%), and Tubifex tubifex (4.6% to
0.2%), while the following species indicative of
only slight enrichment increased: Aulodrilus limnobius
(0.0% to 10.3%), and Aulodrilus pigueti (1.3%
to 12.5%). Densities of chironomids declined in the first few
years after the peak in Dreissena at sites in the deep
water/silt region, but then increased so that the difference
in the pre- and post-Dreissena periods was
not significant (P > 0.05) (Table 5). By 1995 and
1996, chironomid densities were similar to or
greater than densities found in the pre-Dreissena
period. While the total number of species collected
in the two periods was similar (16 and 14), there
were shifts in proportions of the dominant taxa. The
proportion of the following species increased the
most: C. anthracinus (25.4% to 34.7%), Chironomus
sp. (2.0% to 17.5%), Cryptochironomus digitatus
(0.3% to 9.5%), and Procladius sp. (3.3% to
7.7%), and the following species declined: Chironomus
semireductus gr. (52.6% to 25.8%), and
Chironomus plumosus (12.5% to 0.0%). The latter
two species are indicative of highly eutrophic conditions
(Saether 1979), and their decline would indicate
an improved trophic state, as indicated by the
oligochaete trophic index. At these sites, the Simpson
Diversity Index increased significantly (P <
0.05) after Dreissena colonization, likely as a result
of the decline in overall abundance of oligochaetes
and the increase in mesotrophic-indicator species
(Fig. 3b).
In the outer bay, significant differences in densities
between the pre- and post-Dreissena periods
were not detected for any of the major taxonomic
groups at the three sites sampled (P > 0.05). However,
after Dreissena became established, there was
a downward trend in densities of sphaeriids at the
13-m site and Diporeia at the 28-m site (Table 5).
The downward trend was not apparent until after
1993; if this year was not considered as part of the
post-Dreissena period, the decline was significant
(P < 0.05) for both taxa. Oligotrophic forms dominated
the oligochaete community in the outer bay
throughout the sampling period. On an annual
basis, the oligochaete trophic index at the three
sites varied from 0.55 to 1.43, and Simpson’s Diversity
Index varied from .69 to .90. Differences
between the pre- and post-Dreissena periods were
not significant for either index (P > 0.05).
Minor taxa collected in the bay during the study
period included Gastropoda (Amnicola limosa,
Probythinella lacustris, Bythinia tentaculata, Physa
sp., Pleurocera acuta, Valvata sincera, and Valvata
tricarinata), Ephemeroptera (Caenis sp., Hexagenia
sp.), Trichoptera (Oecetis sp.), and Isopoda (Caecidotea
racovitzai). Differences were noted in two of
these taxa relative to Dreissena colonization. Oecetis
sp. was more abundant in the post-Dreissena
period at the silty sand site in the inner bay (0/m2 to
10/m2), while C. racovitzai was less abundant at the
28-m site in the outer bay (117/m2 to 1/m2).
In comparing communities in the pre- and postDreissena
periods at each of the ten sites, the Bray
Curtis Index indicated that communities at sites in
the deepwater/silt region changed the most (were
least similar), while communities at the outer bay
sites changed the least (were most similar) (Fig 4).
The index ranged from 0.43 to 0.53 at the former
sites and from 0.67 to 0.69 at the latter sites.
Biomass Trends and Comparisons,
Pre- and Post-Dreissena
As found for density, changes in total macroinvertebrate
biomass (excluding Dreissena) varied by
substrate and depth. Biomass at sites with sand substrates
in the inner bay was significantly greater
(P < 0.05) in the post-Dreissena period (1993 to
1996) compared to the pre-Dreissena period (1987
to 1990), but differences were not significant at
sites with silty sand or silt substrates (P > 0.05).
Biomass at sites with sand increased from a mean
of 0.10 to 0.43 g/m2 (Fig. 5). This increase wasmostly a result of greater numbers of Gammarus,
although a few large gastropods (Bythinia tentaculata
and Pleurocera acuta) were found in 1996 and
not in other years. Gammarus accounted for 30%
and 56% of total biomass in the pre- and post-periods,
respectively. Although not significant, mean
biomass at sites in the deep water/silt region decreased
from 5.5 to 2.9 g/m2, mostly because of
lower densities of oligochaetes in the post-Dreissena
period. Chironomids dominated the biomass at
sites in the deepwater/silt region, accounting for
69% of total biomass in the pre-Dreissena period
and 89% in the post-Dreissena period.
In the outer bay, significant differences in total
biomass between the pre- and post-Dreissena periods
were not detected at the two shallow sites (Stations
24 and 20). Large year-to-year variation
occurred at both sites during the post-Dreissena period
(Fig. 5). Biomass at the deeper 28-m site (Station
23) was significantly lower in the
post-Dreissena period (P < 0.05), and this decline
can be attributed mainly to decreased numbers of
the amphipod Diporeia (Table 5). 

xdiscussion
Trends in densities of the major macroinvertebrate
groups from 1987 to 1996 in Saginaw Bay can
be put into a historical perspective by examining
densities reported in studies over several decades
beginning in the mid-1950s (Surber 1954, 1955;
Alexander 1963; Shannon et al. 1967; Schneider et
al. 1969; Batchelder 1973; Michigan Department of
Natural Resources [MDNR] unpublished data).
Densities from previous studies were converted to
Ponar equivalents as given in Nalepa et al. (2002).
An examination of historical trends was limited to
the deepwater/silt region since organic materials
from both allochthonous and autochthonous sources
eventually focus and settle in this region (Robbins
1981), and therefore changes in the macroinvertebrate
community most closely reflect shifts in the
overall productivity of the system.
In the deepwater/silt region, both oligochaetes
and chironomids increased between the 1950s and
the 1960s/early 1970s (Fig. 6). These increases
were likely a result of increasing nutrient loads and
high system productivity (Vollenweider et al. 1974).
This was also the time period over which the burrowing
mayfly Hexagenia, a pollution sensitive
form, disappeared from the bay (Schneider et al.
1969). Phosphorus abatement programs were initiated
in the mid-1970s, and total phosphorus loads in
the inner bay declined 55% between 1974 and 1980
(Bierman et al. 1984). This resulted in a 53 to 61%
decline in chlorophyll (20.6 to 12.2 µg/L in spring
and 29.1 to 12.2 µg/L in fall) (Bierman et al. 1984),
a reduction in populations of eutrophic indicator
species of phytoplankton (Stoermer and Theriot
1985), and the elimination of nuisance blooms of
blue-green algae (Stoermer et al. 1983). Further reductions
in total phosphorus and chlorophyll were
not apparent between 1980 and 1991 (Fahnenstiel et
al. 1995a).
Despite improvements in water quality, densities
of the dominant macroinvertebrate groups,
oligochaetes and chironomids, changed little or increased between 1971 and 1987 to 1990. This finding
is surprising, particularly for oligochaetes,
given that other studies in the Great Lakes have
found decreases in abundances after abatement programs
(Johnson and McNeil 1986, Schloesser et al.
1995, Nalepa et al. 1998). A close examination of
trends suggests that densities of at least
oligochaetes were abnormally high in 1987 to 1990
and likely not representative of the post abatement
period. For instance, a 1986 survey reported a mean
oligochaete density of 7,200/m2 in the
deepwater/silt region (MDNR unpublished data)
(Fig. 6). This value was far less than the mean of
20,800 m2 in 1987, just 1 year later. By 1991, densities
declined back to 7,900/m2. Given the magnitude
of this increase and decrease over such a short
time period, it is possible that densities were affected
by a short-term storm event that occurred in
fall 1986. A 100-year flood displaced 8 to 200 cm
of surface sediment material from river margins
into the bay (Ludwig et al. 1993). These organic inputs
would have been deposited in the
deepwater/silt region and perhaps led to the dramatic
increase in oligochaete densities the following
year. Densities of tubificid oligochaetes can
increase rapidly after periods of high organic sedimentation
(nearly a 2-fold increase in just a few
months; Lang and Hutter 1981). Consistent with
this theory, the highest proportion of immature tubificids
over the entire sampling period occurred in
1987 (93%). Subsequent declines, particularly after
1990 but before Dreissena, may have been a result
of the population returning to levels more at equilibrium
with the carrying capacity of the bay prior
to this discharge event. Mean annual water temperatures
in the inner bay in 1987 and 1988 were
higher than in the previous 6 years (McCormick
and Fahnenstiel 1999) and this may have also contributed
to greater oligochaete recruitment. If densities
in 1986 and 1991 are considered to be typical of
the post-abatement period, then oligochaete densities
declined about 45% from pre-abatement densities
found in 1971, and chironomids declined by
40%. However, despite these apparent declines in
densities, eutrophic-indicator species of both
groups still dominated the community.
Several distinct changes occurred in the macroinvertebrate
community just after the peak of Dreissena
in 1992. At sites in the deepwater/silt region,
density and biomass of both oligochaetes and chironomids
decreased sharply, even though few mussels
were ever found in this region. It is likely that,
at least initially, filtering activities of abundant
Dreissena populations in the sand/shallow water regions
of the bay led to diminished organic inputs
into the deepwater/silt region, leading to a decline
in densities of these two groups. Strayer and Smith
(2001) reported a similar pattern in the Hudson
River estuary; that is, Dreissena populations in
shallow-water areas had a negative impact on
macroinvertebrate populations in adjacent deepwater
areas where no Dreissena were present. In
inner Saginaw Bay, this response was evident for
just a few years after the 1992 peak in Dreissena.
By 1995 to 1996, oligochaete densities had increased from earlier lows, and chironmid densities
were greater than found prior to Dreissena. The
oligochaete trophic index declined after 1992 and
remained lower through 1996, indicating that increased
densities in 1995 and 1996 consisted of
species reflective of more oligotrophic conditions.
In terms of other taxa, of particular interest was
the number of Hexagenia spp. collected in the
deepwater/silt region of the inner bay. As noted,
this pollution-sensitive species was once abundant
in this habitat, but disappeared in the 1950s. Over
the 9-year study period, five individuals were collected
in the inner bay, two in 1990 and three in
1994, and all were found at Station 11 (Nalepa et al.
2002). In western Lake Erie, Hexagenia returned to
former abundances in the early 1990s after a
decades-long absence (Edsall et al. 1999). Hexagenia
was not found in Saginaw Bay in the early
1970s (Batchelder 1973; GLRD unpublished), so
the finding of a few individuals is noteworthy. Yet a
large-scale return to Saginaw Bay, although predicted
(Schaeffer et al. 2000), had yet to occur
through 1996.
There were two clear responses to the establishment
of Dreissena in the shallow water/sand region:
an increase in Gammarus and a decrease in
Sphaeriidae. Similar to the present study, most
other studies have reported a similar response in
these two taxa (Howell et al. 1996, Haynes et al.
1999). Gammarus apparently benefits from increased
habitat complexity created by Dreissena
clusters, and from increased food availability generated
by mussel biodeposits (Ricciardi et al. 1997,
Stewart et al. 1998). In this study, densities of Gammarus
in the post-Dreissena period (240 to 494/m2)
exceeded historical densities (152/m2 in 1956 [J. C.
Schneider unpublished data] and 97/m2 in 1971
[Batchelder 1973]). The decline in sphaeriids has
been attributed to physical attachment by Dreissena,
or to competition for food (Lauer and McComish
2001, Strayer and Smith 2001).
In contrast to some studies, we did not observe
any changes in densities of oligochaetes or chironomids
in response to Dreissena in the shallow
water/sand region. Relative impacts of Dreissena on
these two groups are variable and appear to be a
function of where samples were collected relative to
Dreissena clusters. Some studies have shown that
densities of these two groups are higher within, or
adjacent to, mussel clusters than in surrounding substrates
(Karatayev et al. 1997, Bially and MacIsaac
2000). Yet other studies have shown that, overall,
densities of oligochaetes and chironomids did not
change or declined after Dreissena introduction (Johannsson
et al. 2000, Kilgour et al. 2000, Strayer
and Smith 2001). Mussels do provide more suitable
habitat and/or food for these groups but, as argued
by Strayer and Smith (2001), local studies within
mussel beds neglect changes on a broader spatial
scale. The local impact of Dreissena on oligochaetes
and chironomids is a function of mussel density
(Karatayev et al. 1997). At sand sites in the inner
bay, mussel densities in individual replicates with
mussels ranged from 1 to 42,390/m2 (mean =
3,855/m2). Yet even with these densities on a local
scale, no relationship between Dreissena and densities
of oligochaetes and chironomids was observed.
The decline of the amphipod Diporeia in the outer
bay is consistent with declines in other regions of
the Great Lakes after Dreissena became established
(Dermott and Kerec 1997, Nalepa et al. 1998,
Lozano et al. 2001). A common theory for the decline
in Diporeia is that mussels are outcompeting
Diporeia for food resources settling to the bottom,
particularly diatoms (Nalepa et al. 1998, Dermott
2001). Inconsistent with this theory, at least in the
outer bay, is the fact that neither chlorophyll nor diatom
biovolumes in the water column declined at
Station 23 between 1991 and 1996 (Johengen et al.
2000; H. A. Vanderploeg unpublished data). Diporeia
densities declined at Station 23 just 2 years after
Dreissena peaked at shallower sites within the outer
bay (Stations 19 and 27), yet Dreissena was never
collected at Station 23 over the entire sampling period.
While Diporeia has declined in areas where
both Diporeia and Dreissena are found in immediate
proximity (Dermott and Kerec 1997), the decline at
Station 23 in outer Saginaw Bay provides another
example of populations that have declined in areas
removed from Dreissena, and where food resources
are still apparently available to sustain at least some
of the population (Dermott 2001).
Based on the relative proportion of the various
substrate types within the inner bay (57% sand,
16% silty sand, and 27% silt; Robbins 1981), and
mean biomass of benthic communities within each
substrate type, system-wide changes in benthic biomass
were calculated for each sampling year. The
inner bay is a well-mixed, semi-confined system,
and thus net gains or losses of benthic biomass may
be interpreted relative to overall system productivity.
When considered as a whole, biomass of the
non-dressenid macroinvertebrate community was
affected by Dreissena for only a short time period
(Table 6). While decreases were apparent immediately
after the peak in Dreissena in 1992, biomassincreased after Dreissena populations apparently
stabilized. Mean yearly biomass of 2.30 and 2.72 ×
109 g in 1995 and 1996 were not different from values
of 2.14 to 3.57 × 109 in 1987 to 1990 prior to
Dreissena. Thus, the energetic demands of Dreissena
ultimately did not come at the expense of the
non-dreissenid benthic community. The same finding
was reported for the western basin of Lake Erie
(Johannsson et al. 2000), a system similar to inner
Saginaw Bay. When Dreissena is included, standing
stocks of the total benthic community in the inner
bay were 2 to 6 times greater in 1993 to 1996 compared
to 1987 to 1990 (Table 6). The question remains
how the non-dreissenid benthic community
can be sustained given the added energetic requirements
of the dreissenid population. The system is
dominated by detritivores (oligochaetes and chironomids),
and conceivably the availability of detrital
food did not decline or perhaps even increased.
While chlorophyll levels declined 61% in the inner
bay after Dreissena became established (Fahnenstiel
et al. 1995a), standing stocks of benthic
macroalgae and submersed macrophytes increased
because of increased light penetration to the bottom
(Skubinna et al. 1995, Lowe and Pillsbury 1995).
As calculated by Fahnenstiel et al. (1995b), a decrease
in phytoplankton production was almost
compensated for by an increase in benthic algal
production, without even considering a potential increase
in other benthic producers such as vascular
hydrophytes and metaphytonic algae. Moreover, the
potential for increased nutrient supply rates resulting
from Dreissena excretion would enhance
growth rates of both benthic and pelagic algae
(Heath et al. 1995). In addition, large, late summer/fall
blooms of the cyanophyte Microcystis have
been documented in the inner bay beginning in
1994 as a result of selective rejection by Dreissena
(Vanderploeg et al. 2001). When settled to the bottom,
this alga may enhance food availability to the
benthos, either directly or indirectly through increased
bacterial production (Brunberg and
Bostrom 1992).
A number of studies have examined macroinvertebrate
changes within a specific habitat type, such
as within hard-substrate habitats colonized by
Dreissena, but few have determined changes on a
system-wide basis. After Dreissena colonized the
Hudson River, Strayer and Smith (2001) reported a
10% gain in non-dreissenid biomass at shallow
water sites, but a 50% loss at deepwater sites.
Based on the proportion that each habitat comprised
of the river system, it was estimated that nondreissenid
biomass declined 40% on a riverwide
basis. In comparison, a 58% overall decline was
found in non-dreissenid biomass in the inner bay
within 2 years after the peak in Dreissena (1993 and
1994), but then biomass increased such that there
was no difference in biomass 3 to 4 years (1995 and
1996) after the Dreissena peak when compared to
the pre-Dreissena period (1987 to 1990). In 1995
and 1996, mean biomass at the shallow-water/sand
sites increased by 84% compared to 1987 to 1990,
while biomass at the deepwater/silt sites declined
by 27%.
Even though total non-dreissenid macroinvertebrate
biomass did not change as a result of the introduction
of Dreissena in the inner bay, Dreissena
likely enhanced the amount of food available to
upper trophic levels. When considering macrobenthic
forms that are most readily fed upon by many
fish such as chironomids, Gammarus, and sphaeriids
(Wells 1980), the decline in sphaeriids was more
than offset by the increase in Gammarus, and no
long-term changes were observed in biomass of
chironomids. For example, yellow perch in the
inner bay fed primarily on chironomids in the late
1980s (Schaeffer et al. 2000), but also will feed on
amphipods when available (Haygood and Margraf
1987). The 5-fold increase in Gammarus over most
of the inner bay without a corresponding decline in
chironomids will likely have a positive effect on
this fish species. The assumption, of course, is that
Gammarus is available to fish and not sheltered
from predation within mussel clusters. When considered as a whole, the fish community in the inner
bay shifted to more benthic-feeding forms since
Dreissena became established (Thomas and Haas
1997). In the outer bay, the introduction of Dreissena
will probably have a more negative impact on
upper trophic levels. Although macroinverteberate
biomass at shallower water sites in the outer bay
were not affected by Dreissena, the decline in biomass
at deep-water sites as a result of the loss of
Diporeia will likely adversely affect some fish
species (Pothoven et al. 2001).
In summary, it was difficult to determine a clear
response of the benthic macroinvertebrate community
to phosphorus abatement efforts over the time
period of this study. The community in the deepwater/silt
region of the inner bay, the best location in
the bay to interpret long-term trends, was likely affected
by a major storm event that occurred just
prior to our initial sampling. This confounded interpretations
of abatement efforts. Densities of the two
major groups, oligochaetes and chironomids, were
likely 45% and 40% lower after abatement and before
Dreissena colonization, but eutrophic species
still dominated each of these groups. After Dreissena
became established, oligochaete densities initially
declined in the deepwater/silt region of the
inner bay, but then returned to values near those
found in the pre-Dreissena period. Also, the
oligochaete community shifted to species more indicative
of an improved trophic state, and overall
species diversity increased. Sphaeriids declined in
the shallow/sand and silty sand regions, but Gammarus
increased. Species diversity in these regions
was little changed after Dreissena colonization. Despite
shifts in community composition, non-dreissenid
biomass in the entire inner bay was
unchanged relative to biomass found in the preDreissena
period by the end of the sampling period.
In the outer bay, the most significant change was a
decrease in biomass at deeper depths as a result of a
decline in Diporeia. The increase of Gammarus in
the shallow, nondepositional regions of the inner
bay, and the loss of Diporeia in the deeper regions
of the outer bay have contrasting implications to the
food web.
