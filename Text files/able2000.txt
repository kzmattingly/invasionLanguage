xabstractThe tidally inundated marsh surface is an important site for energy exchanges for many resident a transient species. In many areas along the East Coast of the U.S. the dominant vegetation, Spartina altermiflora, has bee replaced by the common reed (Phragmites australis). This shift has caused concern about the impact of Phragmites on marsh fauna but research in this area has been limited. During 1997 and 1998, we examined the effect of Phragmites fish and decapod crustacean use of the marsh surface in the brackish water reaches of the Mullica River, in southern New Jersey, U.S. Fish and decapod crustaceans were sampled with an array of shallow pit traps (rectangular glass dish 27.5 x 17.5 x 3.7 cm) and with flumes (1.3 m wide x 10 m long of 3.2-mm mesh). Fish (2-60 mm TL) dominated p trap collections with Fundulus heteroditus and Fundulus luciae significantly more abundant at Spartina sites. Fundulus he eroditus was also the dominant fish (15-275 mm TL) collected in flumes but collections with this gear, including a numb of species not collected in pit traps, showed no distinct preferences for different marsh vegetation types. Decapo crustaceans (1-48 mm CW) collected in pit traps were generally less abundant than fishes with Calinectes sapidus a Palaemonetes spp. most abundant in Spartina, while Rhithropanopeus harrisii was most abundant in Phragmites. The sam decapod crustacean species (2-186 mm CW) dominated the flume collections and, similar to the pattern of fish collecte by the flumes, there were no distinct habitat preferences for different marsh vegetation types. As a result of the observations, with different sampling techniques, it appears there is an overall negative effect of Phragmites on larva and small juvenile fish but less or no effect on larger fish and decapods crustaceans.

xintroduction
  Introduction
 The tidally inundated marsh surface is believed
 to be an important site for energy exchanges for
 resident and transient fishes and decapod crusta-
 ceans (Kneib 1997b; Cicchetti and Diaz 2000; Dee-
 gan et al. 2000). This is evident based on the great
 abundance of fishes and decapod crustaceans that
 typically occur there (Kneib 1984, 1987a,b; Talbot
 and Able 1984; Rozas and Reed 1993; McIvor and
 Rozas 1996; Cicchetti and Diaz 2000). One reason
 for these high abundances is that the marsh sur-
 face provides a spawning site for many fish species
 (Able and Castagna 1975; Taylor et al. 1979; Mid-
 daugh and Takita 1983; Taylor and DiMichele
 1983; Conover and Kynard 1984; Kneib 1986). In
 addition, it is an important feeding area for some
 species (Weisburg and Lotrich 1982) and a refuge
 from predation for others (Kneib 1987b). The lat-
 ter helps explain why the marsh surface is such an  
important nursery for small individuals of species
 such as Fundulus heteroclitus and Fundulus luciae
 (Byrne 1978; Taylor et al. 1979; Kneib 1984, 1986,
 1987a, 1997a,b; Talbot and Able 1984; Able and
 Fahay 1998). This same pattern of marsh surface
 as habitat for feeding and refuge is also true for
 some decapod crustaceans including the blue crab
 (Callinectes sapidus) and shrimps (Welsh 1975; Zim-
 merman and Minello 1984; Kneib 1987b; Fitz and
 Wiegert 1991; Rozas and Reed 1993; Peterson and
 Turner 1994; Minello 1999; Cicchetti and Diaz
 2000).
 In the northeastern United States especially, salt
 marshes have been invaded by the common reed,
 Phragmites australis, which has replaced Spartina al-
 terniflora and other species on the marsh surface.
 Phragmites was formally a minor component of the
 tidal marsh vegetation for at least 3,000 yr (Niering
 and Warren 1977; Orson et al. 1987); in the last
 several decades it has become much more abun-
 dant in many marsh systems along the East Coast
 of the U.S. This invasion and replacement of other
 marsh species has been documented for Connect-
 icut (Roman et al. 1984), New York (Winogrond
 1997), New Jersey (Windham 1995; Windham and
 Lathrop 1999), Delaware (Hellings and Gallagher
 1992; Sneddon et al. 1995), Maryland (Rice and
 Stevenson 1996), Virginia (Havens et al. 1997; Pyke
 and Havens 1999), and South Carolina (Stalter
 and Baden 1994). The increase in the distribution
 and abundance of Phragmites has raised concern
 about its impact on natural marsh systems, the as-
 sociated fauna, and energy exchanges between
 marshes and the adjacent estuary (Roman et al.
 1984; Marks et al. 1994; Weinstein and Baletto
 1999; Meyerson et al. 2000; Weinstein et al. 2000).
 For example, the change in vegetation that occurs
 during this invasion may influence marsh surface
 topography by raising the substrate level above the
 water table and smoothing the surface topography
 because of increased litter production, and thus
 eliminating the water-filled hollows typically found
 in Spartina dominated marsh surface (Windham
 and Lathrop 1999). On the other hand, others
 have suggested that it should be introduced into
 selected areas to increase marsh elevation in order
 to compensate for marsh loss due to sea level rise
 (Stevenson et al. 2000).
 Despite these contradictory concerns, there has
 been little focused effort to determine the impacts
 of Phragmites on the fauna associated with the salt
 marsh surface. An exception to this is a recent
 analysis of the abundance and food habits of E het-
 erocitus in a variety of reference marshes, domi-
 nated by Juncus gea-dii, Typha angustifolia, and
 Spartina patens, relative to Phragmites-dominated
 marshes in the lower Connecticut River (Fell et al.
 1998). These authors suggested that marshes with
 Phragmites appeared to be functioning in the same
 way as nearby reference marshes of variable vege-
 tation based primarily on fish abundance and food
 habits. Further, an analysis of trophic linkages be-
 tween E heteroclitus and marsh vegetation indicated
 that this species derived some of the nutrients in
 its tissue from Phragmites when found in marshes
 dominated by this vegetation (Wainright et al.
 2000).
 We examined macrofaunal use of the marsh sur-
 face in Phragmites-dominated areas largely because
 this species has shown a marked increase in the
 relatively undisturbed, low salinity marshes at Mul-
 lica River in southern New Jersey in recent years
 (Windham 1995; Windham and Lathrop 1999).
 We examined the potential influence of Phragmites
 on the fauna that use the marsh surface as a nurs-
 ery by comparing the species composition, abun-
 dance, and size of fish and decapod crustaceans
 on P australis versus S. alterniflora dominated
 marsh surfaces. Preliminary results of a portion of
 this study were presented as an example of the val-
 ue of pit trap sampling for assessing fish abun-
 dance on the marsh surface (Able 1999).

xmethods
 STUDY AREA
 Sampling occurred on Hog Islands (Fig. 1) lo-
 cated in the upper reaches of the Mullica River, a
 portion of the Jacques Cousteau National Estua-
 rine Research Reserve in NewJersey, U.S. (Able et
 al. 1995), which is an appropriate study area for
 three reasons. First, the recent invasion of P aus-
 tralis has been thoroughly documented through
 analysis of aerial photography. The percentage of
 vegetative cover of this species has increased from
 3.2% to 83.1% between 1971-1991 (Ferren et al.
 1981; Windham 1995; Windham and Lathrop
 1999). Further, this increase in Phragmites seems to
 be representative of other brackish water sites with-
 in this estuary (Windham 1995). Second, this es-
 tuary and the study area has relatively few human
 impacts (Able et al. 1995), which could mask the
 effects of vegetation on macrofaunal use of the
 marsh surface. Third, the close proximity of the
 different vegetation types means that interpreta-
 tion is not as likely to be impacted
 physical characteristics.

 SITE SELECTION AND DESCRIPTION
 During 1997, four sites were sampled on Hog
 Islands, two P australis-dominated areas (Phrag Lw
 and Phrag Up) and two S. alterniflora-dominated
 areas (Spart B and Spart D) (Table 1 and Fig. 1).
 During 1998, a total of eight sites were sampled,
 four P australis-dominated areas (Phrag A-D) and
 four S. alterniflora-dominated areas (Spart A-D). All
 sites were within an approximately 1.5 km area.
 Phragmites australis sites were invaded, except Phrag
 A, after 1971 (Windham personal communication;
 Table 1). Spartina alterniflora sites at Hog Islands
 were generally small (< 500 m2) and fragmented,
 surrounded on all sides by Phragmites.
 Marsh surface elevation largely controls the area
 of marsh surface that is flooded, and the amount
 of time the marsh surface remains flooded at high
 tide. Thus, elevation is important in understanding
 the spatial and temporal availability of marsh sur-
 face habitat for fish and nektonic invertebrates.
 Relative elevation among locations was determined
 with a tripod-mounted Electronic Distance Ma-
 chine (EDM), prism pole, and Sokkia surveying
 program. This method provided benchmarks on
 sites used during 1997 and potential sites to be se-
 lected for 1998 that were relative to other loca-
 tions. Relative elevation of the marsh surface at
 each pit trap was then measured with a hand-held
 level and stadia rod and these elevations were ref-
 erenced to the benchmarks.
 Based on these methods, it was determined that
 sites selected for the 1997 field season differed in
 marsh surface elevation between vegetation types
 (ANOVA: F1,2 = 2217.58, p = 0.0005) with Phrag-
 mites-dominated sites lower (at a location approxi-
 mately 15 cm from the marsh edge) than Spartina-
 dominated sites (Fig. 2). Therefore, during 1997,
 Phragmites-dominated sites were more available to
 nektonic macrofauna than Spartina-dominated
 sites. In order to eliminate elevation as a confound-
 ing variable, we selected sites for the 1998 field
 season after reviewing relative elevations deter-
 mined for potential sites. As a result, during 1998
 relative elevation at the pit traps was not signifi-
 cantly different between vegetation type (ANOVA:
 F1,6 = 0.36, p = 0.569) (Fig. 2). During both years,
 elevation for pit traps varied with distance from the
 marsh edge with a general increase in elevation
 with increasing distance from the marsh edge (AN-
 OVA 1997: F2,4 = 20.16, p = 0.0008; 1998: F2,12 =
 39.86, p = 0.0001) (Fig. 2) but those within the
 same site and distance from the marsh edge gen-
 erally varied less than 10 cm. Spartina sites were
 more variable than Phragmites at the higher eleva-
 tion with two sites similar at the 5.0 and 9.5 m dis-
 tance from marsh edge while one site was lower
 and one site was higher.
 During 1998, a general description of the marsh
 surface topography at each site was compiled at the
 end of the field season. Percent standing water (>
 1 mm of water) on the marsh surface was visually
 determined within a 10 m area encircling the pit
 trap array and flume. Three individuals qualitative-
 ly assessed the amount of standing water on the
 marsh surface and the range of their estimates
 were recorded. Measurements were taken just after
 the tide had receded from the marsh surface,
 therefore these are maximum estimates of avail-
 able standing water. A count was also made of any
 pools of water and any creeks within this area.
 Marsh surface topography differed by vegetation
 type (Table 1). Standing water was present on all
 Spartina-dominated sites and covered as much as
 40% of the marsh surface. In Phragmites-dominated
 sites little or no standing water (0-5%) was pre-
 sent. These estimates were consistent with our ob-
 servations during the field season, i.e., the marsh
 surface on Phragmites marshes was always drier.
 There were some small (< 0.5 m wide), shallow
 intertidal creeks present on or adjacent to the
 study sites, however, these were found on both veg-
 etation types.
 PHYSICAL AND ABOVEGROUND VEGETATION
 CHARACTERISTICS
 During the entire study period (May 16-October
 31, 1997 and May 1-October 8, 1998), water salin-
 ity (%o), temperature (?C), and pH were recorded
 every 30 min by a datalogger (Endeco YSI Envi-
 ronmental Monitoring Systems-PC6000). During
 1997, the datalogger was placed adjacent to one of
 the Phragmites sites (Phrag Lw) in 1 m of water
 (Fig. 1). In 1998, it was placed between the two
 islands in 2 m of water. There were some extended
 time periods in which the datalogger was either
 removed for routine maintenance or it malfunc-
 tioned, including June 5-18, 1997, July 4-14, 1997,
 July 26-31, 1997, September 25-30, 1997, and July
 11-13, 1998. Hand-held point estimates of temper-
 ature (alcohol field thermometer) and salinity (re-
 fractometer) were taken when flume cod ends
 were set and retrieved. These data were compared
 with datalogger data to ground truth values and
 were found comparable.
 To characterize vegetation type and biomass, two
 replicates of aboveground vegetation were taken at
 three distances from the marsh edge (0.5, 5.0, and
 9.5 m) at each sampling site on August 8, 1997 and
 August 13, 1998. In previous years, this time period
 proved to be at the peak of growth of these species
 at this location and therefore represent maximum
 stem density, biomass, and height (Windham
 1995). For each replicate, all live and dead stand-
 ing stems within 0.25 m2 quadrats were clipped at
 ground level, identified to lowest possible taxa,
 counted, bagged, and dried to a constant weight
 (g) to determine biomass. Length (cm) of 10 live
 random stems from each quadrat were measured
 before drying.
 FAUNAL SAMPLING TECHNIQUES
 At each site, larval and juvenile fish and decapod
 crustaceans were passively collected on the marsh
 surface with shallow pit traps, rectangular glass
 dishes (27.5 X 17.5 X 3.7 cm) that were sunk flush
 with the marsh surface. These traps served as mim-
 ics of the shallow water habitats typically used by
 larval and small juvenile fish and crustaceans dur-
 ing periods in which the marsh is not inundated
 and were functionally similar to those used to col-
 lect fish on the marsh surface in North Carolina
 (Kneib 1978), Georgia (Kneib 1984, 1987b,
 1997a), and New Jersey (Talbot and Able 1984;
 Marteinsdottir 1991). At each site, a total of nine
 traps were arranged in three parallel rows at three
 distances (0.5, 5.0, and 9.5 m) from the marsh
 edge. Pit traps within each row were placed 0.5 m
 apart. An elevated boardwalk was installed in early
 spring before vegetation developed and this gave
 access to the pit traps without altering the marsh
 surface. On each sampling date, pit traps were
 completely emptied at low tide prior to flooding at
 high tide. After the water receded from the marsh
 surface on the next low tide, the contents of the
 traps were emptied into bags and refrigerated for
 several hours before being sorted in the laboratory.
 All fish and decapod crustaceans were preserved
 in 95% ETOH. Fish and crabs were measured to
 the nearest 0.1 mm total length (TL) or carapace
 width (CW), respectively, using calipers. Fundulus
 spp. were identified using descriptions compiled
 by Hardy (1978) and Able and Fahay (1998). Pit
 trap sampling occurred twice each month at or
 near daytime spring tides from June through Oc-
 tober 1997 (total of 10 sampling dates and 355 in-
 dividual pit trap sets) and April through October
 1998 (total of 11 sampling dates and 782 individual
 pit trap sets). A total of 5 pit traps in 1997 (1.5%
 of 1997 total sets) and a total of 10 pit traps in
 1998 (1.3% of 1998 total sets) did not flood due
 to unusually low spring high tides and these were
 excluded from analyses.
 Larger juvenile and adult fish and decapods us-
 ing the marsh surface were collected at each site
 with a single flume net (Mclvor and Odum 1986),
 adjacent to the pit trap arrays. The flumes consist-
 ed of two parallel (1.3 m apart) walls (1 m high X
 10 m long of 3.2-mm mesh) extended perpendic-
 ularly from the marsh edge. The back of the flume
 was blocked with similarly sized mesh. At high tide,
 a weighted mesh bag cod end (1.3 m X 1.3 m with
 3.2-mm mesh) was attached to the flume to enclose
 the sampling area. As the tide receded, transient
 fauna that occurred on the marsh surface at high
 tide moved into the cod end. The cod end was
 retrieved at low tide. We attempted to increase cap-
 ture success within each flume with modified Gee
 minnow traps (length = 45 cm, diam = 23 cm,
 mesh = 0.64 cm2), which were positioned inside
 each flume after the cod end was in place. Al-
 though some animals were collected in these traps,
 the overall catch rates were not dramatically en-
 hanced. As a result, trap catches were combined
 with flume data for all analyses. Flume sampling
 occurred from April through October 1998 (total
 of 11 sampling periods and 264 sets). Each sam-
 pling period included three consecutive days (at
 or near spring tides) of flume sampling on daytime
 high tides. All fish and selected decapod crusta-
 ceans were identified, counted, and measured in
 the field. Fish were measured either to the closest
 millimeter total length (TL) or fork length (FL).
 Decapod crustaceans were measured to the closest
 millimeter carapace width (CW). All fork lengths
 of fish were converted to total lengths for compar-
 ison using regressions from Able and Fahay
 (1998).
 ANALYSIS
 Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test
 for the effect of vegetation type and other factors
 on relative marsh surface elevation, stem density
 (live and dead), aboveground biomass (live and
 dead), live stem height, and overall fish and deca-
 pod abundance collected by flume. The unit of
 replication was a pit trap for elevation, quadrat for
 vegetation, and flume set for fish and decapod
 analyses. Our blocked factorial design included
 vegetation type (Spartina or Phragmites) and dis-
 tance from marsh edge (0.5, 5.0, or 9.5 m) and
 interactions with location blocked for elevation
 and vegetation analyses. The model for flume anal-
 ysis differed with the exclusion of distance from
 marsh edge and inclusion of month (April-Octo-
 ber). Aboveground biomass and overall fish and
 decapod abundance collected by flume was log-
 transformed and stem height was square root
 transformed in order to meet the assumptions of
 the ANOVA. Separate analyses were conducted for
 each year (1997 and 1998).
 Since the assumptions necessary for ANOVA
 were not met for some sampling techniques, over-
 all abundance of fish and decapods collected by
 pit trap and species specific comparisons of fish
 and decapods collected by both pit trap and flume
 were analyzed with nonparametric statistics. Sepa-
 rate Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to exam-
 ine differences between vegetation type (Spartina
 and Phragmites) and distance from marsh edge
 (0.5, 5.0, and 9.5 m) within each vegetation type
 for pit trap collections, while flume collections
 were only tested between vegetation type.

 PHYSICAL AND VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS
 During the sampling period the datalogger de-
 ployed in the sampling area recorded seasonally
 variable values of salinity and temperature (Fig. 3).
 Some of the variability between years may have re-
 sulted from the different depths of deployment,
 i.e., 1 m in 1997 and 2 m in 1998. Mean salinities
 were similar between years and the range of values
 were similar as well (1997: mean = 7.0%o, range
 = 0.0-19.1; 1998: mean = 8.1%o, range = 0.0-
 18.8). The timing of minimum and maximum val-
 ues varied somewhat between years. In 1997, salin-
 ities < 5.0%o occurred in May, June, and August
 while in 1998 these values occurred in May, June,
 and July. Maximum values (> 15.0%o) in 1997 oc-
 curred in July, August, and October while in 1998
 these values were in July, August, September, and
 October. Temperatures followed a seasonal pattern
 in both years with lowest mean temperatures in
 May and highest in July (Table 2). Mean temper-
 atures were higher in 1998 (23.3?C) than in 1997
 (20.6?C) even though the datalogger was at greater
 depth in 1998. pH was variable in this system with
 similar mean (6.6 and 6.7) and overall range (4.1-
 7.7) of values for 1997 and 1998, respectively. In
 general, the lowest pH was associated with in-
 creased river runoff and low salinities (Able un-
 published data).
 The characteristics of the vegetation at the dif-
 ferent marsh types was consistent between years al-
 though it varied somewhat among locations (Table
 1). Phragmites sites were monotypic stands of P. aus-
 tralis while the Spartina sites were dominated by S.
 alterniflora with S. patens, Scirpus americanus, and
 Amaranthus cannabinus present to a lesser degree.
 Several vegetation characteristics differed marked-
 ly between the Phragmites and Spartina sites (Fig.
 4). In 1997 and 1998, the average density of live
 stems was significantly greater at the Spartina sites
 than for Phragmites (ANOVA 1997: F1,2 = 108.5, p
 = 0.009; 1998: F1,8 = 14.1, p = 0.006); while the
 density of dead stems was similar between vegeta-
 tion types during both years (ANOVA 1997: F12 =
 0.58, p = 0.527; 1998: F,8 = 2.16, p = 0.180). The
 average live biomass (ANOVA 1997: F12 = 38.49,
 p = 0.025; 1998: F,8 = 89.45, p = 0.0001) and the
 average height (ANOVA 1997: F1,2 = 254.56, p =
 0.004; 1998: F,8 = 135.57, p = 0.0001) of above-
 ground vegetation was consistently greater for
 Phragmites than for Spartina sites in both years.
 SIZE COMPOSITION OF THE FAUNA
 Although the size composition of fish and deca-
 pod crustaceans varied with sampling gear, pat-
 terns were similar regardless of vegetation type
 (Figs. 5 and 6). Pit traps caught smaller fishes and
 decapod crustaceans than flumes. For fishes, the
 mean size in pit traps was 14.5 mm TL while fishes
 in flumes were much larger (mean = 59.4 mm
 TL). Thus, individuals collected in pit traps were
 predominantly recently hatched young-of-the-year,
 while those collected in flumes represented large
 young-of-the-year and older age classes. There was
 some overlap in size of fishes in these two gears
 from approximately 19-61 mm TL, but these rep-
 resented a relatively small proportion of the fish
 collected in pit traps. For decapod crustaceans, the
 differences in size by collecting gear were not as
 pronounced. The mean size was 7.8 mm CW in pit
 traps and 30.0 mm CW in flumes but there was
 considerable overlap in the range of sizes from ap-
 proximately 3-22 mm CW.
 DISTRIBUTION AND ABUNDANCE OF FAUNA
 Overall fish use of Spartina-dominated marsh was
 significantly and consistently higher than for Phrag-
 mites-dominated marsh for small fishes based on pit
 trap collections in both years (Kruskal-Wallis 1997:
 X2 = 86.8, p = 0.0001; 1998: x2 = 183.14, p =
 0.0001) (Table 2 and Figs. 7 and 8). The rarity of
 fish in Phragmites-dominated marshes is evident by
 the fact that only 15 individuals were collected in
 1997 and 33 individuals in 1998 of the 1,600 in-
 dividuals captured in both years (Table 2). The
 spatial pattern of fish use within these vegetative
 types was similar for both years based on pit trap
 collections (Fig. 7). Distance from the marsh edge
 within Spartina marshes had a significant effect on
 fish, i.e., Fundulus spp., abundance with pit traps
 positioned 0.5 m from the marsh edge typically
 capturing fewer fish than pit traps at 5.0 m and 9.5
 m from the marsh edge (Kruskal-Wallis 1997: x2 =
 35.98, p = 0.0001; 1998:.52 106.52, p = 0.0001)
 (Fig. 7). So few fish were capture d at the Phrag-
 mitesdom 1998 (n = ing dated sites that no pattern was discern-
 able. No significant differences (ANOVA: Fon =
 0.24, p i 0.641) occurred in flume collections
 where the abundance of larger fish typically caught
 in this gear averaged 3.6 at 0.3 individuals per 1.3
 mm of marsh edge in Spartina and 2.8 + 0.5 in
 Phragmites (Table 2 and Fig. 9).
 Overall decapod crustacean use varied among
 marsh-surface p it trap collections (Table 2 and
 Figs. 7 and 9). During 1997, vegetation type did
 not have a significant effect on decapod abun-
 dance (Kruskal-Wallis: 02 = 1.229, p = 0.268);
 while vegetation was significant in 1998 (Kruskal-
 Wallis: x2 = 9.471, p = 0.002). Similarly, during
 1997, distance from marsh edge did not signifi-
 cantly affect decapod distribution on either Spar-
 tina (Kruskal-Wallis: x2 = 2.23, p = 0.328) or Phrag-
 mites (Kruskal-Wallis: x2 = 5.705, p = 0. 0577)
 marshes; while in 1998, it did (Kruskal-Wallis Spar-
 tina: x2 = 16.80, p = 0.0002; Phragmites: x2 =
 21.866, p = 0.0001) (Fig. 7). These differing pat-
 terns of significance between years may have been
 the result of a smaller sample size in 1997 than
 1998. There was no significant difference in abun-
 dance of decapods in flume collections between
 Spartina and Phragmites sites (F1,6 = 0.25, p =
 0.635) (Table 2 and Fig. 9).
 The temporal pattern of fish and decapod abun-
 dance was generally similar between vegetation
 types and collecting gears (Figs. 8 and 9). For fish-
 es collected in pit traps at Spartina sites, catches
 were low or zero in May, June, September, and Oc-
 tober (Fig. 8). Peak abundance was in midsummer,
 early July in 1997 and late July in 1998, with abun-
 dance slightly greater in 1997 (12.1 + 2.4) than in
 1998 (9.0 ? 1.4) (Fig. 8). For decapod crustaceans
 in Spartina, abundance peaked in August 1997 and
 September in 1998 (Fig. 9). Peak catches in Phrag-
 mites were most noticeable in 1997 in June and Oc-
 tober (Fig. 9). No peaks were observed in Phrag-
 mites in 1998. For flume collections, patterns of
 abundance varied with the faunal group. For fish-
 es, the pattern of abundance was variable (Fig. 8);
 for decapods, abundance peaked during August
 through October in both Spartina and Phragmites
 (Fig. 9).
 SPECIES COMPOSITION
 The species composition of recently hatched lar-
 vae and small juvenile fishes collected in pit traps
 varied with vegetation type and this pattern was
 consistent across years (Table 2). During both
 years, F. heteroclitus dominated the catches in both
 vegetation types (1997; 98.2%, n = 521 total fish:
 1998; 96.3%, n = 1,130). The only other species
 to consistently occur in the collections was another
 marsh resident, F luciae. In each year, 97% of the
 E heteroclitus (Kruskal-Wallis 1997: x2 = 83.63, p =
 0.0001; 1998: x2 = 177.89, p = 0.0001) and 100%
 of the E luciae (Kruskal-Wallis 1997: x2 = 5.201, p
 = 0.023; 1998: x2 = 23.064, p = 0.0001) occurred
 in Spartina marshes. No fish species collected by
 pit trap was dominant in Phragmites (Table 2).
 The composition of decapod crustaceans in pit
 traps varied between years and with vegetation type
 (Table 2). In 1997, two crabs, Callinectes sapidus
 (56.0%) and Rhithropanopeus harrisii (41.5%),
 made up the vast majority of the individuals col-
 lected (n = 159 total decapods). In 1998, Palae-
 monetes spp. (85.5%) made up much of the catch
 (n = 675 total decapods) even though only a single
 individual was collected in 1997. Other contribu-
 tors included Uca spp. (7.4%), R harrisii (3.8%),
 and C. sapidus (3.0%). The distribution of these
 species relative to vegetation type was species spe-
 cific (Table 2). During both years, Callinectes sapi-
 dus was consistently more abundant in collections
 in Spartina (1997: 81%; 1998: 95%) (Kruskal-Wallis
 1997: x2 = 13.686, p = 0.0002; 1998: x2 = 16.138,
 p = 0.0001). During 1997, R harrisii (91%) was
 significantly more abundant in Phragmites (Kruskal-
 Wallis: x2 = 31.60, p = 0.0001). During 1998, Pa-
 laemonetes spp. were collected exclusively in Sparti-
 na (Kruskal-Wallis: x2 = 49.72, p = 0.0001), while
 most Uca spp. (80%) were collected in Phragmites
 (Kruskal-Wallis: x2 = 13.835, p = 0.0002).
 The overall species composition of the fauna col-
 lected with flumes was similar to the pit traps for
 decapod crustaceans but differed markedly for
 fishes (Table 2). Fundulus heteroclitus was still the
 dominant fish (84.2% of 848 total fish) collected
 in flumes. E luciae (1.5%) also occurred. Other
 species unique to flume collections included Mo-
 rone americana (4.4%), Menidia menidia (2.9%), Go-
 biosoma bosc (2.6%), Anguilla rostrata (2.2%), and
 Gobiosoma spp. (1.1%). With flume sampling, F het-
 eroclitus was evenly distributed between Spartina
 (55%) and Phragmites (45%) (Kruskal-Wallis: x2 =
 3.820, p = 0.0507). This pattern was similar for all
 other fish species except A. rostrata which was sig-
 nificantly more abundant in Spartina (Kruskal-Wal-
 lis: x2 = 4.305, p = 0.038). Most decapod species
 collected by flume were evenly distributed by veg-
 etation type except for R harrisii which was more
 abundant in Spartina (Kruskal-Wallis: x2 = 5.247, p
 = 0.022).

 INFLUENCE OF SAMPLING TECHNIQUE
 The patterns of distribution and abundance of
 fishes and decapod crustaceans in this study varied
 between collecting gears and vegetation type. The
 influence of sampling technique is especially criti-
 cal in interpreting faunal use patterns on the to-
 pographically complex marsh surface, especially
 for the very small, early life history stages of fishes.
 In this study we relied on two sampling approaches
 to help characterize the nekton in the different
 vegetation types, flumes and pit traps. The advan-
 tages of flumes are that they presumably provide a
 quantitative measure of abundance for nekton that
 move onto the marsh surface with flooding tides
 (McIvor and Rozas 1996; Rozas and Minello 1997).
 Typically, the mesh sizes in prior studies, as in this
 one, are too large to retain recently hatched larvae
 and small juvenile fishes (see Fig. 5). Pit traps are
 non-quantitative samplers (Kneib 1987a, 1997a)
 and these and other techniques used to sample
 marsh surface nekton may be biased by a variety
 of factors (Fulling et al. 1999).
 On the other hand, pit traps offer the advantage
 that they appear to mimic natural water-filled de-
 pressions on the marsh surface, and thus may in-
 troduce fewer artifacts into a sampling program
 targeting young-of-the-year Fundulus spp. than con-
 structing large structures such as flumes which in-
 fluence the direction and location of capture
 (Kneib 1991; Kneib and Wagner 1994; Kneib and
 Knowlton 1995). Clearly, these two sampling ap-
 proaches influenced the size and species compo-
 sition of the fishes and decapods captured. As a
 result, pit traps consistently captured smaller indi-
 viduals of fewer species (primarily F heteroclitus),
 while flumes captured larger and a more diverse
 group of fishes and decapods. Thus, gear type
 strongly influenced the interpretation of the nek-
 ton using the marsh surface. As a result, if we had
 only sampled with flumes we may have concluded
 that the size and faunal composition of fishes and
 decapods of Phragmites versus Spartina marshes is
 similar and that vegetation type does not influence
 the fauna. The primary reason that fish abundance
 in flumes appeared similar between vegetation
 types is that the overwhelming dominant species,
 i.e., large juvenile and adult F heteroclitus (mean =
 58.1 ? 0.6 mm TL), were evenly distributed be-
 tween vegetation types. However, other species had
 greater abundance in Spartina relative to Phragmi-
 tes. For example, G. bosc and Gobiosoma spp. (prob-
 ably the same species because the only other Go-
 biosoma in this estuary [ G. ginsburgi] is distributed
 in higher salinities; Duval and Able 1998), and A.
 rostrata were significantly more abundant or exclu-
 sively found (F luciae) in Spartina (Table 2). The
 only fish species that appeared more abundant in
 Phragmites was M. menidia. Unfortunately, the only
 other study that addresses faunal use of the marsh
 surface in Phragmites-dominated marshes (Fell et
 al. 1998) used a different sampling technique
 (Breder traps; Breder 1960) of unstated mesh size
 to capture fishes moving onto the marsh surface.
 Perhaps because Breder traps were used to capture
 fishes as they moved on and off the marsh surface,
 they had a species composition similar to our
 flume collections, i.e., shared a number of species
 besides F. heteroclitus, including Morone americana,
 Menidia spp., and Anguilla rostrata. No size infor-
 mation is available from Fell et al. (1998), so no
 further comparisons with our study are possible.
 Together these flume and pit trap sampling
 techniques provide a fuller understanding of nek-
 ton use of the marsh surface than either gear sep-
 arately. Together they demonstrate the full size
 spectrum of fishes and decapods that use the
 marsh surface and present a slightly different view
 of seasonality on the marsh surface. For the
 flumes, the periods of abundance appear to be lon-
 ger in duration for fishes and decapods, but the
 peaks in abundance of decapods in pit traps, at
 least, were more pronounced in 1998. While spe-
 cies composition of decapods appeared similar for
 both gears, there was a marked difference for the
 fishes as indicated above. The influence on the
 above parameters is likely due to the differences
 in sampling modes, i.e., flumes sample primarily
 transient nekton moving on and off the marsh sur-
 face, and pit traps sample primarily the resident
 nekton as they move around on the marsh surface.
 INFLUENCE OF VEGETATION TYPE
 The patterns of decapod use of the Spartina and
 Phragmites-dominated marsh surface varied be-
 tween years and sampling techniques, as previously
 discussed. The species composition in pit traps dif-
 fered markedly between years and these differenc-
 es probably reflected differences in availability.
 The large numbers of Palaemonetes spp. in 1998 ac-
 counted for the peak in decapod abundance in
 September and October and this occurred at the
 same time as a dramatic increase in salinity and
 decrease in pH at the study area (Fig. 3). This sug-
 gests that high salinity (Table 2) water from lower
 in the estuary brought large numbers of Palaemo-
 netes and/or their larvae into the Hog Islands area.
 This pattern was reflected in increased catches of
 shrimp in the flumes as well. The abundance rel-
 ative to vegetation type varied with individual spe-
 cies in the pit trap collections (Table 2). In both
 years, C. sapidus was more abundant in Spartina
 and R. harrisii was more abundant in Phragmites. In
 1998, the Palaemonetes spp. were exclusively found
 in Spartina. We suspect that these patterns by C.
 sapidus and Palaemonetes are due to a behavioral
 preference as they move on to the marsh surface
 on flooding tides.
 The overall species composition of decapods was
 similar between pit traps and flumes in 1998. Two
 possible exceptions were that C. sapidus was rela-
 tively much more abundant and Uca spp. were less
 abundant in flume collections relative to pit trap
 collections. These exceptions may be the result of
 differences in life history patterns of these species.
 Callinectes sapidus is a transient on the marsh sur-
 face (Fitz and Wiegert 1991; Cicchetti and Diaz
 2000) and therefore is more susceptible to the
 flume gear which collects animals as they are leav-
 ing the marsh surface; while Uca spp. reside on the
 marsh surface regardless of tide and are less sus-
 ceptible. Differences relative to vegetation type
 were not so clear within flume collections with
 most species of similar relative abundance regard-
 less of vegetation type.
 Others have determined that some of the same
 species of decapods use the marsh surface. For C.
 sapidus, this was documented in Texas (Minello
 and Zimmerman 1992), Louisiana (Rozas and
 Reed 1993), Georgia (Fitz and Wiegert 1991), and
 South Carolina (Mense and Wenner 1989) marsh-
 es, and now we have confirmed that it occurs in
 New Jersey as well. The same pattern of use of the
 marsh surface is evident for Palaemonetes spp. in
 Texas (Minello and Zimmerman 1992), Louisiana
 (Rozas and Reed 1993; Peterson and Turner
 1994), and Georgia (Kneib and Wagner 1994), and
 we have identified that this occurs on New Jersey
 salt marsh surfaces, although it varied annually at
 our typically low-salinity study area. Taken together
 it appears that decapod crustaceans can make up
 a significant component of the marsh surface fau-
 na in NewJersey and elsewhere and should be con-
 sidered as potentially important mediators of en-
 ergy flow and trophic interactions from the marsh
 surface to adjacent intertidal and subtidal habitats
 (see Cicchetti and Diaz 2000).
 The pattern of fish species composition varied
 with vegetation type, based on pit trap sampling,
 perhaps as a result of the differences in marsh to-
 pography associated with vegetation. Fundulus lu-
 ciae was captured exclusively in Spartina marsh, per-
 haps because it lives in shallow depressions on the
 marsh surface (Able et al. 1983). If future studies
 confirm its absence in Phragmites marshes, that
 would be one example of how this vegetation type
 reduces biodiversity.
 The much reduced abundance of small, recently
 hatched F heteroclitus in Phragmites-dominated
 marshes merits special attention because this is
 probably the most important fish species in marsh-
 es along the East Coast of North America due to
 its abundance and the roles it plays in marsh tro-
 phodynamics both as predator and prey (Kneib
 1986, 1997b). Additionally, the habitat use, growth,
 and survival of the larvae and small juveniles may
 be particularly important to the population dynam-
 ics of this species (Kneib 1993, 1997a) as occurs
 for many other species of fish (e.g., Able and Fahay
 1998). The greater abundance of F heteroclitus lar-
 vae and small juveniles in Spartina relative to Phrag-
 mites-dominated marsh may be due to several fac-
 tors. First, the patterns of abundance may reflect
 spawning site preference. It is well documented
 that F heteroclitus deposits its eggs as it moves onto
 the marsh surface in Spartina marshes at the base
 of Spartina stems (Taylor et al. 1977) and in ribbed
 mussel (Guekensia demissa) shells (Able and Castag-
 na 1975; Able 1984; Able and Hata 1984). This ef-
 fect could be enhanced if there is fidelity to the
 spawning site by the larvae. Second, differential
 survival of eggs and larvae could also account for
 the differences observed, as could preference of
 larvae for Spartina marshes.
 Perhaps the simplest explanations are that E het-
 eroclitus prefer to spawn in Spartina dominated
 marshes and the larvae have a high degree of fi-
 delity to these sites. The first suggestion has yet to
 be tested. However with regard to the latter, there
 are numerous examples of the use of intertidal
 marsh surface puddles and depressions as micro-
 habitat for larvae and small juveniles of E heterocli-
 tus in NewJersey (Talbot and Able 1984), Delaware
 (Taylor et al. 1979), North Carolina (Kneib and
 Stiven 1978), and Georgia (Kneib 1984, 1986,
 1987a, 1997a,b). Thus, these likely serve as essen-
 tial habitats for early life history stages. These hab-
 itat types were present in the variable topography
 of the Spartina sites in this study but infrequently
 in the Phragmites sites where standing water was sel-
 dom present (Table 1). The flat "table top" to-
 pography appears to be characteristic of Phragmites
 marsh surfaces at Hog Islands (Windham and La-
 throp 1999), and in marshes along Delaware Bay
 (Weinstein and Balletto 1999). Our own extensive
 observations in a variety of Phragmites-dominated
 marshes in Delaware Bay (Able et al. unpublished
 data) confirm the difference in marsh topography
 between these vegetation types. Perhaps, as sug-
 gested by Windham and Lathrop (1999), the high
 litter production in Phragmites marshes may fill de-
 pressions in the marsh surface, thus raising the soil
 level above the water table, as well as smoothing
 the surface topography. Both of these would re-
 duce the number and size of depressions and thus
 serve to eliminate the nursery habitat for recently
 hatched Fundulus spp. as noted above. Further-
 more, if Phragmites causes the marsh surface to be
 elevated, as has been suggested (Stevenson et al.
 2000), it may reduce access to the marsh surface
 in general and eliminate it as a feeding and nurs-
 ery area. If this process varies with age of Phrag-
 mites, i.e., older stands have flatter topography,
 then all of the above effects may vary among stands
 of Phragmites and confound interpretation of ef-
 fects on the fauna unless age or other factors that
 influence marsh surface topography are taken into
 consideration. However, even when we created
 standing water on the Phragmites marsh surface
 with pit traps, we caught very few fish, suggesting
 that there are few in the Phragmites marsh sites in
 general.
 Clearly, the sources of larvae, i.e., local repro-
 duction or movement from adjacent sources,
 needs to be resolved for this and other Phragmites-
 Spartina marsh comparisons to see if our results for
 larvae and small juveniles can be confirmed. Ad-
 ditionally, the possibility of differential larval pref-
 erence and survival needs to be investigated fur-
 ther to determine the source of these differences
 in distribution and abundance.
 Other physical characteristics and faunal com-
 ponents also differ across these vegetation types at
 some of the same study sites (Angradi et al. un-
 published data). In their study, benthic macroin-
 vertebrate density and richness was greater in Spar-
 tina than Phragmites. In the Phragmites marshes, de-
 trital biomass was higher, as was water velocity.
 Both variables may be responses to vegetation type
 and density. Also, species composition varied
 across vegetation types, perhaps because of large
 amounts of standing water on the marsh surface at
 their Spartina sites and generally drier conditions
 in Phragmites marshes (Bertness 1999).
 In summary, vegetation type and associated mi-
 crotopography influenced fish and decapod use of
 the marsh surface at Hog Islands, especially for F
 heteroclitus an important component of marsh tro-
 phic relays. However, more studies at a variety of
 sites need to be completed before we can confirm
 the patterns observed in this study. These future
 attempts to evaluate the effects of Phragmites
 should incorporate detailed site analysis including
 microtopography, elevation, and soil characteristics
 as well as age of Phragmites sites. Clearly, faunal
 sampling techniques are a major consideration.
