xabstract
We present an example of how an invasion
by a non-native cyprinid (common bream, Abramis
brama (Pisces: Cyprinidae), hereafter bream) in a
natural shallow lake in southern Europe (Lake Montorfano,
northern Italy) may have adversely affected
the state of the lake’s ecosystem. In less than two
decades, bream became the most abundant species and
characterized by a stunted population with asymptotic
length 33.5 cm, an estimated mean length at first
maturity of 19.6 cm, a total mortality rate of
0.64 year-1 and a diet overwhelmingly dominated by
microcrustaceans. Following bream establishment,
nutrients and phytoplankton biomass rose, the proportion
of Cyanobacteria by numbers increased markedly
and water transparency decreased. Total zooplankton
abundance increased with a marked increase in small
cladocerans and copepods, whereas the abundance
of large herbivorous cladocerans did not change.
The coverage of submerged macrophytes declined, as
did the abundance of native pelagic zooplanktivorous
fish. The composition of the fish community shifted
towards a higher proportion of zoobenthivorous species,
such as bream and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus).
Our results indicate that bream affected water quality
through bottom-upmechanisms,while top-downeffects
were comparatively weak. Selective removal of bream
and perhaps stocking of native piscivores might improve
the ecological status of the lake.

xintroduction
Non-native species, i.e. species outside their natural
range which frequently become established and
abundant following their introduction (Rejma´nek et al.
2002; Cambray 2003), are increasingly recognized as
constituting one of the main threats to biodiversity and
ecosystem functioning (e.g. Ricciardi and Mc Isaac
2011) and are often associated with environmental
degradation (Biro 1997; Wilcove et al. 1998; Byers
2002). Furthermore, in the case of freshwater fish
faunas such biotic homogenization frequently has high
ecological and economic costs (Welcomme 1998;
Rahel 2000).
Successful non-native species are often characterized
by high physiological tolerance and functional
characteristics different from those of the members of
invaded communities (Moyle and Marchetti 2006;
Bollache et al. 2008), enabling them to occupy vacant
niches and to spread and increase rapidly. Moreover,
successful non-native species have been reported to
affect the functional diversity of communities with
possible strong impacts on food webs and ecosystem
functioning (Hooper et al. 2005; Britton et al. 2010;
Simberloff 2011). Additionally, as invasions by nonnative
species in novel environments are often characterized
by boom-bust phenomena (Strayer and
Malcom 2006; Salonen et al. 2007; Volta and Jepsen
2008; Liso et al. 2011) with strong recruitment leading
to high densities, the adverse effects on ecosystem
processes may be further exacerbated.
Southern European fresh waters, including those of
Italy and other countries adjacent to the Mediterranean
Sea, are isolated from those of the rest of Europe.
Mountain ranges have prevented the migration of
aquatic and many other organisms from northern and
central Europe, thus favouring isolation and allopatric
speciation (Bianco 1998; Hewitt 1999; Rayol et al.
2007). However, the anthropogenic introduction of nonnative
species, a long-lasting and continuing process,
has recently led to homogenization of the fish fauna and
coexistence of native and non-native species in several
southern European basins (Clavero and Garcia-Berthou
2006; Gherardi et al. 2007; Kottelat and Freyhof 2007).
In particular, the Italian peninsula has experienced the
introduction of several non-native fish species since the
Roman and Middle Ages. During the 1800s, stocking of
water bodieswith newfish species became awidespread
practice with the purpose of enhancing the production of
commercially valuable fish species and, later, species of
angling interest. This has resulted in a local shift from
salmonids and coregonids to centrarchids and, more
recently, cyprinids (Bianco 1998; Gherardi et al. 2007).
Common bream (Abramis brama) (hereafter bream)
is native in most European drainages, from parts of the
UK in the west to the White Sea basin in the east, but it
is naturally absent from the Iberian peninsula, the
Adriatic basin, Italy, northern and western parts of the
British Isles and north of 67N. However, in recent
decades, this cyprinid has been introduced to Spain and
Italy (Benejam et al. 2005; Kottelat and Freyhof 2007).
Although both adaptable and tolerant to different kinds
of water bodies (e.g. Jeppesen et al. 2006; Lapirova and
Zabotkina 2010), this potentially large-bodied fish
prefers meso-eutrophic shallow lakes with a dense
vegetated area or reed belt around the shoreline
(Lammens et al. 2004; Mehner et al. 2005; Kottelat
and Freyhof 2007). It is a zoobenthivorous species
(Lammens and Hoogenboezem 1991; Persson and
Bro¨nmark 2002) and is in some cases known to have a
significant negative effect on the water quality in
shallowlakes (Tatrai et al. 1990; Breukelaar et al. 1994;
Vanni 2002). The potential to exert adverse effects on
lake food webs and ecosystem functioning operates
through at least two mechanisms: (1) through a
reduction the abundance of large zooplankton followed
by increased phytoplankton abundance (top-down
mechanism) (Brooks and Dodson 1965; Shapiro et al.
1975; Carpenter et al. 1985; Benndorf et al. 2002) and,
(2) through increased nutrient cycling due to an
increased excretion rate at the community scale and
the disturbance of bottom sediments through ‘bioturbation’
(Meijer et al. 1990; Vanni 2002; Verant et al.
2007) favouring phytoplankton growth (bottom-up
mechanism). Furthermore, bream often has a pronounced
migratory behaviour (e.g. Schulz and Berg
1987; Borcherding et al. 2002; Skov et al. 2011) and
may consequently move considerable distances to other
lakes within a river system. Finally, although often
attaining large individual sizes, this species may also
develop stunted high density populations becoming
locally abundant, with potential negative consequences
both within and beyond the local fish community due to
competition for food resources (Van de Wolfshaar et al.
2006; Persson et al. 2007) or hybridization (Hayden
et al. 2010). In combination, these features make bream
a potentially effective and highly undesirable invader
of southern European waters.
The introduction history of bream in Italy began as
recently as the 1980s (Delmastro 1983; Marconato
et al. 1985). Its distribution is still scattered and in
running waters it is currently limited to a few small
stretches of slow-flowing rivers and canals in the
eastern part of the north-eastern lowlands, and to the
main rivers Arno (Tuscany region) and Tevere
(Latium region) in central Italy (Mancini et al. 2005).
Its presence in lentic waters is known to be confined to
only three lakes belonging to different catchments but
with similar limnological characteristics: Lake Monticolo
Grande (Trentino Alto-Adige Region, Adige
river drainage), Lake Fimon (Veneto Region, Tagliamento
river Drainage) and Lake Montorfano (Lombardy
Region, river Po catchment). These three lakes are
shallow (max depth\9 m), small (area\1 km2), range
from mesotrophic to eutrophic (TP between 20 and
60 lg L-1) and have a dense vegetated area or reed
belt around the shoreline.
Most studies on the biology and ecology of bream
have been undertaken in temperate-cold regions of
Europe (Slooff and De Zwart 1982; Kangur 1996;
Specziar et al. 1997; Persson and Hansson 1999;
Lammens et al. 2004), while the knowledge of bream
populations in southern European and Mediterranean
countries is very scarce (Treer et al. 2003; Benejam
et al. 2005). This is particularly true for Italian lakes.
Hence, an understanding of the life-history features of
non-native bream combined with knowledge of the
environmental state before and after introduction is
essential to the assessment of its possible effects on the
ecosystem functioning of lacustrine environments.
Such knowledge may also help lake managers to
decide on appropriate strategies to be implemented to
improve the health of fish communities and the water
quality (Mehner et al. 2004; Ribeiro et al. 2008).
In this study we describe the population biology and
life-history traits of a bream population introduced to
Lake Montorfano in northern Italy and we examine the
effects of this invasion on the lake ecosystem using a
dataset comprising abiotic and biotic information from
before and after the introduction. Finally, we propose
measures to control this invasive species and improve
the ecological status of Lake Montorfano.

xmethods
Lake Montorfano (45470N, 9080E) is a small
(0.51 km2) shallow (maximum depth 6.8 m, mean
depth 4.15 m) and wind-protected lake located in
northern Italy (Lombardy region, Como district) at an
altitude of 397 m a.s.l. It is naturally oligo-mesotrophic
and fed by underground waters and its outlet is
partly regulated by a very small weir immediately
adjacent to the lake. There are no significant point
sources of pollution as sewage was diverted in the
1980s and is now collected and brought to a treatment
plant discharging into its outlet.
The native fish assemblage was described by Monti
(1864) as including eight species: bleak (Alburnus
arborella), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Padanian
goby (Padogobius martensi), Italian roach ‘‘triotto’’
(Rutilus aula), pike (Esox lucius), perch (Perca
fluviatilis), rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) and
tench (Tinca tinca). Largemouth bass (Micropterus
salmoides) and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) were
stocked during the 1930s (de Bernardi et al. 1985).
Fish sampling was carried out from 18 to 20 October
2010 using benthic multi-mesh survey gill nets
(Appelberg et al. 1995) and electrofishing. Each net
was 30 m long and 1.5 m high and composed of
twelve panels with mesh sizes ranging from 5.5 to
55 mm and each 2.5 m long). In addition, further
panels with mesh sizes of 70, 90, 110 and 135 mm
(same length as the other panels) were added to three
of the nets in order to catch potentially larger fish. In
total 16 gill nets were distributed randomly within
three different depth strata (0–3, 3–6, 6 m to bottom)
on two consecutive days of sampling. On the first day
additional larger mesh sizes were added to one net for
each depth stratum. Nets were set at dusk between
18:00 and 19:00 and retrieved the following morning
between 07:00 and 08:00. The fish collected were all
individually measured (total length, LT), weighed
(total body mass, WT) and scales were taken for age
determination. The distribution of fish in the littoral
area was further evaluated by electrofishing from a
boat. The electrofishing device was a built-in-frame
EL64GII (Scubla Acquaculture, 7,000 W, 600 V, DC
current) set up with a copper cathode (width 2.5 cm,
length 300 cm) and with a steel ring anode (thickness
0.8 cm, diameter 50 cm). The Point Abundance
Sampling Electrofishing (PASE) method (Copp and
Garner 1995) was used, in which the anode is dipped
for 20 s at each sampling point. A total of 99
points was sampled. The stunned fish were measured
(total length LT); rarer species were also weighed (WT),
and scales were taken for age determination.
The ages of the fish were determined by scale
analysis on a subsample of ca. 150 specimens of each
species randomly selected among the entire catch,
with 1 June being selected as the nominal birth date for
the bream. Age was expressed in months. Sexual
maturity was determined by gonadal inspection on a
subsample of 100 specimens. Additionally, digestive
tracts of 50 bream, randomly selected and ranging in
length between 8 and 28 cm, were removed and stored
separately in 5 % formaldehyde for subsequent diet
examination and analysis as described below.
Catch per unit effort (CPUE) for nets was assessed
with respect to net area and calculated as biomass per
unit effort (BPUE, g m-2) and number per unit effort
(NPUE, individuals m-2). CPUE for electrofishing
was calculated as NPUE (individuals dip-1).
The body mass-length relationship was calculated
using the equation:
logarithmically transformed into the equation:
where W is body mass (g) and LT total length, a and
b are the intercept and the slope of the regression.
Length-at-age data were used to estimate the
parameters of the Von Bertalanffy (1938) growth
function (VBGF) according to the equation:
where LT is total length of the fish at time t, L? is the
theoretical maximum length an average fish could
achieve, k is the growth constant which determines
how fast the fish approaches L?, and t0 is the
hypothetical age at LT = 0.
The U0 Phi-prime index (Pauly and Munro 1984)
was used to compare the growth performance of bream
with those of other populations described in the
literature according to the equation:

where k and L? are parameters of the VBGF.Mean
length at maturity Lm for pooled sexes was estimated
from L? according to the equation (Froese and
Binohlan 2000):

where Lm is the theoretical average length at which the
fish could have its first reproduction and L? is the
asymptotic length calculated by the VBGF.
Additionally, a logistic regression was used to fit
sigmoid curves to the proportion of mature fish versus
length.
Total instantaneous mortality (Z) was estimated
from the linearized catch curve (Sparre and Venema
1988) using fish captured with multi-mesh survey gill
nets using the following equation:

where N is the number of fish of age t, a and b are
estimated through linear regression analysis; b, with
sign changed, is an estimate of total instantaneous
mortality Z.
The natural mortality rate M was estimated using
the empirical equation of Pauly (1980), which provides
an estimate of M on the basis of L? and k of the
VBGF and the annual mean water temperature (see
below for local data source) according to the equation:

where L? is the ultimate length an average fish could
achieve, k is the growth constant of the VBGF, and T is
the mean annual water temperature.
Digestive tracts were opened and their contents dried
for 15 min on blotting paper. The food items were
identified under a stereomicroscope as close as
possible to the genus or species level. Benthos and
zooplankton were identified according to Campaioli
et al. (1994) and Margaritora (1983), respectively.
Diet analysis was accomplished using Costello’s
method (Costello 1990) which is based on a two
dimensional representation of the diet, where every
point represents, for each prey, the occurrence (the
percentage ratio between the number of stomachs
where the prey is found and the total number of
stomachs) and the abundance (the ratio between the
number of organisms into the stomach and the total
number of prey). With this method it is possible to
assess the importance of the prey in the diet (dominant
or rare) and the type of diet (specialized or generalized).
The limnological characteristics of Lake Montorfano
have been determined monthly in a number of years
during the last two decades (1991–1992, 1998–1999,
and 2004–2007) as a part of a monitoring programme
carried out by the University of Milan. Sampling was
performed at a central location at the lake site with
maximum depth. Water samples for chemical analysis
were taken monthly using Van Dorn bottles at the
following depths: 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 m. The samples
were transferred to the laboratory for immediate
analysis. Secchi disk depth, temperature and dissolved
oxygen were measured in situ. Temperature and
oxygen concentrations were determined with an
automatic oxygen sensor coupled with a thermistor
probe (Microprocessor Oximeter WTW OXI 320).
The following parameters were measured in the
laboratory: pH (pH meter Radiometer PHM 83),
conductivity (conductimeter Radiometer CDM 83),
total phosphorus (Valderrama 1981), nitrate nitrogen
(Rodier 1984), silica (APHA et al. 1985) and Chlorophyll
a (Lorenzen 1967).
Phytoplankton were sampled monthly at six depths
in the 0–6 m layer and pooled, from which a
subsample was fixed in acetic Lugol’s solution and
later counted under an inverted microscope (see Leoni
et al. 2007). The guidelines of Bourrelly (1968, 1970,
1972) and Huber-Pestalozzi (1983) were used to
identify the algae, mostly to species level. At least 200
individuals of the most abundant species were
counted, with a counting error of about 15 % (Lund
et al. 1958). The cell volume for each species was
estimated according to Rott (1981).
Zooplankton were sampled using a net of 25 cm
diameter and 200 lm mesh size. Sampling was
performed along a vertical gradient to a depth of
6 m; three samples were taken at each point along the
gradient after which the filtered material was mixed
and preserved in 4 % formalin. The taxa present in the
lake were identified using Dussart (1969), Margaritora
(1983), Amoroso (1984), and Reddy (1994) and
counted with an optical microscope.
Differences in the series of limnological features of
Lake Montorfano were tested using one-way
ANOVA. If data were not normally distributed, the
non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used. If
significant differences were detected within a series,
appropriate multiple comparison procedures (Holm–
Sidak method following ANOVA and Dunn’s method
following Kruskall–Wallis test, with significance at
p level = 0.05) were used to detect differences among
groups. The Mann–Whitney test was used if only two
groups were initially present. Variability of the data
was expressed as standard deviations. Statistical
analyses were all performed using Sigma Plot statistical
package (2008 version 11, Systat software).

xresults
Results of the fish sampling are presented in Table 1.
In all 3,867 individuals belonging to nine fish species
were caught. By numbers, bream comprised 62 %,
followed by pumpkinseed (19 %), perch (12 %) and
rudd (5 %). Captures of pike, largemouth bass, tench
and Italian roach were very infrequent (2 % overall).
BPUE of the gill nets ranged from2.7 to 99.3 g m-2
(mean = 55.9 ± 27.1 g m-2) and NPUE from 0.02 to
6.15 ind. m-2 (mean = 3.1 ± 1.9 g m-2). No fish
were captured in the additional larger mesh sizes.
NPUE of electrofishing ranged from 1 to
290 ind. dip-1 (mean = 17.6 ± 34.0 ind. dip-1).
Bream dominated the gillnet catches by both
biomass and numbers (Table 1) at all depths (Fig. 1a,
b) whilst the pumpkinseed was the most abundant
species in the in the electrofishing catches of the
littoral zone (Table 1).
BPUE of bream in the gill nets ranged from 2.7 to
73.2 g m-2 (mean = 41.3 ± 20.4 g m-2) and NPUE
from 0.02 to 3.95 ind m-2 (mean = 2.1 ± 1.1 ind
m-2). Total length of the bream caught with gill nets
(Fig. 2a) ranged from 5.2 to 31.5 cm (mean
11.0 ± 4.0 cm) and total body mass was on average
20.2 g (±32.8 g). Average size increased significantly
with water depth (ANOVA F = 4.215, df = 2,
p = 0.033), and the largest fish was thus captured in
the deepest lake stratum (Fig. 2b).
In the littoral zone, bream was very scarce with an
average NPUE of 0.17 ± 1.41 ind dip-1. Mean body
length of the bream caught by electrofishing was
8.9 cm (±0.7 cm).
A total of six age classes was identified, i.e.
0–5 years. Calculated asymptotic length L? was
33.5 cm (±0.93 cm 95 % CI), and the growth curve
parameter k was 0.037 (±0.003 95 % CI). Length-atage
is shown in Fig. 2c.
The body mass-length relationship for both sexes
pooled and log–log transformed was described by the
following equation:
The calculated mean length at maturity Lm was
19.6 cm (95 % CI = 18.1–21.2 cm), higher than the
Lm (14.30 ± 0.92 cm, 95 % CI) calculated using the
logistic regression fitted to our data (Fig. 1d). As
different proportions of male and females occurred in
the two samples differences in length are also likely to
occur, but both samples strongly indicate early
maturity. Estimates of natural mortality M and total
mortality Z were similar (0.61 and 0.64 year-1,
respectively), suggesting a negligible fishing pressure.
The contents of digestive tracts consisted entirely of
microcrustaceans and rotifers (Fig. 3). The diet of the
bream was strongly specialized, chydorids being the
most frequent and abundant food item occurring in all
the digestive tracts and accounting for an average of
ca. 62 % in terms of numbers. Bosmina sp. was also
important although not evenly found in the stomachs.
Sediment was present in most of the digestive tracts
but was not quantitatively measured.
From 1991 to 1999 Secchi depth values were relatively
uniform (Dunn’s method, p[0.05) but they decreased
significantly during the 2000s (Dunn’s method,
p\0.05), ranging from 2.1 m to 6.1 m (median
= 3.9 ± 1.1 m) up to 1999 and from 1.2 to 4.0 m
(median = 2.1 ± 0.7 m) in the two periods, respectively
(Fig. 4a). Total phosphorus concentrations in the
whole water column increased significantly in the
2000s (Holm-Sidak p\0.05), ranging between 8 and
29 lg L-1 (median = 12 ± 13 lg L-1) up to 1999
and 14–34 lg L-1 (median = 22 ± 7 lg L-1) in the
following decade (Fig. 4b). The same trend was
observed for total nitrogen (Fig. 4c) and ammonium
(Fig. 4d). Total nitrogen never exceeded 800 lg L-1 in
the 1990s (median = 563 ± 104 lg L-1) being lower
than in the 2000s (Dunn’s method p\0.05) when they
remained higher than 800 lg L-1 (median = 1,151 ±
265 lg L-1) and reached values as high as
1,600 lg L-1. The ratio between total phosphorus
and total nitrogen in the whole water column did not
change (Kruskal–Wallis, p = 0.108 and p = 0.163
respectively), but in the deeper layer (4–6 m) it
increased significantly (Dunn’s methods p\0.05)
from 33.9 in the 1990s to 45.5 in the 2000s. Ammonium
(Fig. 4d) in the water column was always lower
than 400 mg L-1 (median = 53 ± 128 mg L-1) in
the 1990s and increased significantly in the 2000s
(Dunn’s method, p\0.05), when values rose up to
1,000 mg L-1 (median = 297 ± 330 mg L-1).
However, in the deeper layers (4–6 m), ammonium
had already increased in the late 1990s (Dunn’s
method p\0.05). Differences in oxygen concentrations
in the whole water column were not significant
among the three periods (Kruskal–Wallis, p = 0.637),
but from 2004 to 2007 anoxic conditions at the bottom
of the lake persisted for longer periods in summer
(Fig. 4e).
Biotic variables also underwent important changes
during the study period. In particular, phytoplankton
density increased showing a shift towards more
Cyanobacteria (dominated by globular jelly species
such as Gomphosphaeria spp., Chroococcus spp.,
Aphanotece spp., Aphanocapsa spp., Microcystis spp.
and filamentous species such as Anabaena sp.)
increasing particularly in the late 1990s (Dunn’s
method p\0.05) (Fig. 4f). Among the Cyanobacteria,
Aphanotece spp. was most abundant. Additionally,
chrysophytese and dinophytes increased significantly
in the 2000s (Dunn’s method, p\0.05), whilst
diatoms, criptophytes and chlorophytes, did not
exhibit any significant change (Kruskal–Wallis,
p[0.05). Chlorophyll a concentrations did not
change significantly between the two periods (Kruskal–
Wallis, p = 0.107) (Fig. 4g).
Overall, zooplankton abundance increased markedly,
being higher in the 2000s than in the 1990s(Mann–
Whitney, U = 6.000, p = 0.001, df = 1) (Fig. 4h).
Among cladocerans, the large-bodied Daphnia sp. did
not show any significant change (Mann–Whitney
U = 27.0, p = 0.267, df = 1), but the small-bodied
herbivores (Bosmina longirostris and Ceriodaphnia)
(Fig. 4i) increased significantly (Mann–Whitney
U = 4.0, p\0.001, df = 1) as did the proportion of
small cladocerans (Mann–Whitney Mann–Whitney,
U = 16.0, p = 0.007, df = 1). Cyclopoids dominated
among the copepods and increased notably between the
1990s and 2000s (Mann–Whitney U = 12.0, p =
0.005, df = 1). Calanoids appeared only at the end of
1990s (Fig. 4j).

xdiscussion
Although zooplanktivorous cyprinid fishes such as
rudd, bleak and Italian roach dominate the native fish
assemblage of most Italian natural shallow lakes
(Volta et al. 2011), substantial changes have been
recorded in recent decades. These have included an
increase in the number of alien zoobenthivorous
species such as bream, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and
ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) (e.g. Gherardi et al.
2007; Volta and Jepsen 2008; Lorenzoni et al. 2009;
Ciutti et al. 2011). Lake Montorfano is no exception to
this pattern and its fish community now consists of a
mixture of native and non-native species. How bream
was introduced to the lake is unknown, although
accidental introduction as live bait is a probable
explanation as has been concluded for the recent
arrivals of this and similar species in lakes of isolated
regions of Europe (e.g. Winfield et al. 2011). At the
time of the appearance of bream in Lake Montorfano
in the late 1990s, fishing regulations concerning the
use of live bait and its translocation from different
catchments were inadequate and did not take into
account the seriousness of threats posed by non-native
species. The major limnological characteristics of the
lake, such as its meso-eutrophic status, a mean depth
of ca. 4 m and a dense reed belt, are very favourable
for bream existence (Mehner et al. 2005; Kottelat and
Freyhof 2007). Consequently, is not surprising that its
introduction has resulted in the establishment of a
viable population.
Individuals larger than 35 cm were not captured
in our sampling campaign even though the mesh
sizes of the nets used could potentially catch such
individuals (Psuty and Borowski 1997). According to
Z ˇ
ivkov et al. (1999), the growth of bream in Lake
Montorfano can be classified as ‘type b’
(25.5 cm\L?\59.0 cm), indicating a stunted
population. Accordingly, the ‘Phi’ value is notably
lower than for other bream populations (Table 2),
indicating low growth performance of the individuals
in Lake Montorfano. Stunted bream populations
have previously been reported in the literature and,
in shallow and small lakes, are often associated with
very high fish densities (Cazemier 1982; Kottelat and
Freyhof 2007). The bream population of Lake
Montorfano occurred at all depths, apparently tending
to avoid very shallow waters (\1 m) although
caution must be taken when comparing catches by
gill nets set overnight and daytime electrofishing.
However, our results are consistent with those of
other studies, indicating that bream inhabits mainly
offshore habitats, independently of trophic status
(Jeppesen et al. 2006).
The present diet analyses showed specialization of
bream on chydorids, which are typically bottom
dwelling microcrustaceans, and on small cladocerans,
but less on large cladocerans. Also, sediments were
found in the digestive tracts, indicating a tendency to
feed close to the bottom. An increase in the proportion
of small cladocerans among the zooplankton, however,
indicates higher predation pressure in the pelagic
(Brooks and Dodson 1965; Gliwics 2003), perhaps as
other fish are forced to stay more in the pelagic zone.
However, large daphnids were still abundant suggesting
that any enhancement of top-down control by fish
was relatively weak, as also observed in the shallow
eutrophic Lake Balaton (Tatrai et al. 1990). Other
studies (e.g. Jeppesen et al. 1997a, b), however,
indicate strong top-down control by zoobenthivorous
fish in shallow lakes, except for those rich in aquatic
vegetation.
Whilst a top-down effect by bream on the food web
of Lake Montorfano was apparently relatively weak, a
clear bottom-up effect was evident. Despite the fact
that the external nutrient loading levels are now low
(Buzzi pers. com.), significant increase in nutrient
concentrations (both P and N) has occurred in recent
years. In addition, enhanced ammonium concentrations
were first recorded in the deeper water strata,
subsequently followed by an increase through the
whole water column. Zoobenthivorous fish constitute
an important link between the pelagic and the benthic
parts of lake ecosystems, in part because their feeding
close to the bottom disturbs sediments and so releases
nutrients into the water column (Andersson et al. 1988;
Breukelaar et al. 1994). Nutrient release via fish
excretion constitutes a further indirect pathway from
the benthic to the pelagic zones that can be exacerbated
in cases of high fish densities (Vanni 2002;
Verant et al. 2007). As nutrient concentrations
increased in Lake Montorfano, phytoplankton abundance
also increased. In addition, the algae community
shifted to Cyanobacteria, dominated by Aphanotece
spp. and Anabaena spp., which are able to fix nitrogen
under anoxic conditions. Increase in contribution of
cyanobacteria may further have reduced zooplankton
grazing on phytoplankton (Gliwicz 2005).
Macrophyte coverage in Lake Montorfano showed
a major decrease following the establishment of the
bream population. Two surveys carried out in the
1980s (Provincia di Como 1985) and late 1990s
(Garibaldi, data unpublished) described an aquatic
vegetation characterized by six submerged species
(Ceratophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum spicatum,
Najas marina, Potamogeton pusillus, P. lucens, P.
perfoliatus) and two floating-leaved species (Trapa
natans, Nynphaea alba). In contrast, the early 2000s
were characterized by an almost complete loss of
submerged macrophytes, the aquatic vegetation (from
shoreline to the middle of the lake) being composed of
Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia, T. natans, N.
alba and rare stands of C. demersum (Bianchi et al.
2000; Volta pers. obs.). This development is not
surprising as vegetation is quickly lost when a critical
turbidity is exceeded (Scheffer et al. 1993).
The changes in the limnological features of Lake
Montorfano were moreover accompanied by significant
changes in the fish fauna’s composition. The fish
community had remained stable until the beginning of
the 1990s, being dominated by open water zooplanktivorous
fish such as rudd, bleak and Italian roach (de
Bernardi 1985). A survey undertaken in the early
1990s (Negri 1995) reported the following abundance
percentages (based on numbers) for catches in multimesh
gillnets: rudd (68 %), perch (13 %), largemouth
bass (11 %), tench (3 %) and pumpkinseed
(3 %), other species including small cyprinids (2 %).
In this early 1990s survey, however, the mesh sizes of
the nets were too large to capture small fish (smallest
mesh size 18 mm) and a negative bias towards small
pelagic cyprinids should therefore be taken into
account. Our results indicate a substantial shift in the
fish community from dominance of open water
zooplanktivorous species to dominance of zoobenthivorous
such as bream and pumpkinseed. What
triggered the sharp declines in small native cyprinids
in Lake Montorfano is unknown, but the deterioration
of the ecological status of the lake might have played a
major role. Grimaldi (1971) reports severe mortality
events in bleak populations of north Italian lakes
resulting from eutrophication, and Giussani et al.
(1976) suggested that high levels of ammonium
predispose the gill apparatus of small cyprinids to
fungal and bacteria diseases. Hence, the high level of
ammonium occurring in recent years together with
longer periods of low oxygen concentrations may have
adversely affected the populations of small cyprinids
in the lake. As Hayden et al. (2010) reported that
bream has a high potential for hybridization with roach
(Rutilus rutilus) (F bream 9 M roach), it could be
argued that small cyprinids declined due to hybridization
with bream.
At present, there is an apparently negligible predation
pressure on bream in Lake Montorfano. Nonnative
largemouth bass and pike are the only significant
piscivorous predators in the lake because perch
are on average very small (Table 1). In the present
study, only adult specimens of largemouth bass were
observed and the catch of only a few small specimens
indicates weak reproductive success and recruitment.
Compared with the survey of Negri (1995) in the early
1990s, the abundance of largemouth bass has declined
markedly. This in agreement with studies showing that
in shallow lakes or ponds high densities of zoobenthivorous
fish (Wolfe et al. 2009) or bluegills (Lepomis
macrochirus) (Guy and Willis 1990; Brenden and
Murphy 2004) can adversely affect largemouth bass
populations by predation on eggs or by food competition
at juvenile stages. Moreover, pike density in
Lake Montorfano is low compared to other small,
shallow lakes (Snow 1978; Margenau et al. 1998;
Margenau et al. 2008). As bream population control
through predation or fishing is weak, the number of
bream in the lake is unlikely to decrease significantly
in the near future. Biomanipulation by the removal of
large amounts of bream from offshore waters (e.g.
Søndergaard et al. 2007) can be used as a management
tool to improve water quality and promote piscivorous
predator recovery (de Roos and Persson 2002; de Roos
et al. 2003; Persson et al. 2007). Substantial stocking
of young of the year pike from the local stock might be
considered in order to enhance predation on small
bream (Berg et al. 1997) and promote a return to the
clear state with extensive macrophytes (Søndergaard
et al. 1997), but in most cases the effects of such
manipulations in northern Europe has been poor (Skov
et al. 2003; Skov and Nilsson 2007).
In conclusion, Lake Montorfano has recently
shifted towards a more turbid state with higher nutrient
concentrations despite the fact that the external
nutrient loading levels are now stable and low. This
environmental deterioration followed the introduction
and successful establishment of non-native bream in
the late 1990s. Furthermore, this cyprinid has recently
become the dominant fish species in the lake. The
present study results suggest that bream may have
contributed to the observed changes in the ecological
status of the ecosystem via bottom-up mechanisms,
while top-down effects were less apparent. The size
structure of the bream population, characterized by
dominance of relatively small specimens, has probably
exacerbated the release of nutrients into the water
column. Site-specific adaptive management, as suggested
by Mehner et al. (2004), including control of
the fish community composition and abundance,
supplemented perhaps by stocking of piscivorous fish
could be used to improve the ecological status of the
lake.
